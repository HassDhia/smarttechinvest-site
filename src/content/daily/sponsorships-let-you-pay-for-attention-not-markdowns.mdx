# Sponsorships Let You Pay For Attention, Not Markdowns: What Operators

sponsorships let you pay for attention, not markdowns: You need to drive qualified store visits during Nov 28 Dec 12, 2025 using local media partners without increasing blanket discounts or eroding margin. Local sponsorships can hit the unified targets—**10-15%** base foot-traffic uplift (stretch **25%**), push early-window share from **12-15%** toward **20-30%**, and hold event CPA at or below **0.80 baseline** while delivering **5%**+ QR redemption of footfall. Favor a collab-led holiday play: within 30 days replace one weekend sitewide discount with a co-funded local-station sponsorship, secure on-air plus owned-digital inventory and unique time-bound QR codes, and instrument event CPA and buyer-activity share vs promo intensity to judge success [^2][^3].
