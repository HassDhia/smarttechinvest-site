Walmart's Sparky and Amazon's Rufus aren't just chatbots - they're advertising platforms.\n\nBut at the same time, brands like Marriott, Starbucks, and Lego are doubling down on human experiences that can't be automated.\n\nBoth strategies target the same problem: consumers who've learned to ignore marketing.\n\nOur latest analysis explores what this paradox means for brand partnerships and local activation.\n\n#RetailMedia #AI #BrandPartnerships #Marketing",
  "linkedinPersonalTeaser": "Walmart spent this week announcing AI agents that run ads. Lego spent it turning the Vegas Sphere into a Death Star.\n\nThese seem like opposite strategies. They're actually responses to the same problem: consumers who've stopped paying attention to traditional marketing.\n\nOne camp bets on automation. The other bets on moments that can't be automated.\n\nWhat happens when both are right - just for different purchase decisions?"
