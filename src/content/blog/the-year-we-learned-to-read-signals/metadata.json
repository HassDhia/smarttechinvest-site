Travel platforms are opening infrastructure so any business can compete. And marketers are learning that consistency beats novelty.\n\nThe pattern? The winners aren't the ones with the flashiest tech. They're the ones that finally learned to read the signals their customers have been sending all along.\n\n3 takeaways for operators:\n\n1.
