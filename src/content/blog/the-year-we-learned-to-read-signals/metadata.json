Something that was literally impossible before.\n\nBusiness is claiming a similar shift. American Airlines says AI will understand natural customer questions. Travel platforms promise any brand can compete. Marketers learned consistency beats novelty.\n\nBut here's what the headlines miss:\n\n• Natural language interfaces have been \"the future\" for a decade. Adoption is the hard part.\n\n• \"Automation frees humans for connection\" often means \"automation eliminates roles.\"\n\n• No generative AI tool has solved consistency yet. That's not pessimism, it's the current reality.\n\nThe businesses that win might be the ones that learned to listen. Or they might be the ones that avoided the hype and focused on fundamentals.\n\nThe jury's still out.\n\nFull breakdown: [LINK]",
  "linkedinOrgTeaser": "NEW ANALYSIS: The Year We Learned to Read Signals\n\nFrom neural sensors to airline AI, 2025 was positioned as the year businesses finally started listening to customers.\n\nBut the reality is more nuanced:\n\n• American Airlines betting on conversational AI. Whether travelers want to chat with bots instead of clicking filters remains to be seen.\n\n• \"Democratizing infrastructure\" has been the pitch of 10,000 startups. Some succeeded. Most didn't.\n\n• No generative AI tool has solved the consistency problem yet.\n\nThree takeaways for operators:\n\n1. Audit your listening systems. This is useful regardless of technology choices.\n\n2. Be skeptical of \"automation frees humans\" claims. Sometimes it does. Sometimes it just means fewer humans.\n\n3. Demand consistency from your tools, but know the limits before betting customer experience on it.\n\nRead the full analysis: [LINK]",
