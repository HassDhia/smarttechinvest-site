Trust fragmentation - and why local partners are becoming more valuable, not less.\n\nRead the full analysis:\n\n#LocalActivation #BrandPartnerships #RetailStrategy #ConsumerTrust #MarketingStrategy",
  "linkedinPersonalTeaser": "I noticed something interesting looking at this week's retail news.\n\nThree stories that seem unrelated: 2,000 pharmacy closures, TikTok's ownership drama, and agencies not knowing what skills to hire for anymore.\n\nBut they all point to the same thing - trust fragmentation.\n\nThe old answers (trusted institution, trusted platform, trusted credential) are breaking down. And the places where people actually trust each other - local communities, real relationships - are becoming more valuable.\n\nNot because of some trend piece. Because when CVS closes, someone local gains credibility. When platforms feel unreliable, authentic recommendations carry weight.\n\nThe disruption everyone's worried about is actually an opportunity.\n\nWhat's your take - are brands ready to think smaller in trust radius while staying ambitious in scale?\n\n#LocalActivation #BrandPartnerships #RetailDisruption #ConsumerTrust"
