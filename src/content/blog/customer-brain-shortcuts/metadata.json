Told them one cost $45, the other $5.\n\nBrain scans showed the \"expensive\" wine activated MORE pleasure centers.\n\nNot just self-reported enjoyment. Actual neural activity.\n\nThe perception didn't influence the story. It changed the physical experience.\n\nFor anyone running a gym, retail store, or hospitality venue: you're in the business of constructed experiences whether you realize it or not.\n\nNew post on what neuroscience teaches us about pricing, cognitive load, and why every signal you send either builds or breaks the experience.\n\nhttps://smarttechinvest.com/blog/2025/12/customer-brain-shortcuts"
