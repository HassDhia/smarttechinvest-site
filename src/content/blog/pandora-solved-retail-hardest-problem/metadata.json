  "linkedinTeaser": "Pandora's CTO said it best: \"We don't sell pots and pans. Half of what you buy is the product, and half is the experience in the store.\"\n\nThat experience—the emotional selling that happens when a great associate asks the right questions—has always been impossible to scale.\n\nUntil now.\n\nPandora just deployed an AI sales agent called Gemma. Not a chatbot. A sales agent.\n\nShe asks: Who is this gift for? What's the occasion? What do you want them to feel when they open it?\n\nThen she recommends based on those answers.\n\nTheir service AI (Clara) already resolves 60% of inquiries without humans. NPS jumped 10%.\n\nBut Gemma is different. Gemma's job is emotional connection leading to sale.\n\nFor anyone running a gym, hotel, or retail store: this is the playbook.\n\nYour best employee is now a training dataset.\n\nhttps://smarttechinvest.com/blog/pandora-solved-retail-hardest-problem"
