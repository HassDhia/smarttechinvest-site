The question isn't whether - it's who builds it first.\n\n#BrandPartnerships #AI #LocalActivation #MarketingStrategy",
  "linkedinPersonalTeaser": "Jason Lemkin replaced his entire sales team with AI agents. 10 people became 1.2 humans managing 20 bots.\n\nMost people see this as a sales story.

Finding the right local partners - coffee shops, gyms, retailers - requires the same grinding research work.\n\nWhat if brands could evaluate 500 potential partners per quarter instead of 50? With the same team?\n\nWrote about what this means for local activation."
