  "linkedinPersonalTeaser": "Something interesting is happening in marketing right now.\n\nFor decades, the game was maximize reach, optimize impressions, pray for conversions. But that formula is breaking down.\n\nThe Omnicom-Pinterest deal announced at CES buried the lede: intent beats impressions. Figs is building stores in medical districts instead of malls. And AI is quietly restructuring how purchase decisions get made.\n\nBrands still optimizing for reach will wake up one morning to discover their customers are making decisions in places they never thought to show up.\n\nWhat's your take - is reach-based marketing actually dying, or just evolving?"
