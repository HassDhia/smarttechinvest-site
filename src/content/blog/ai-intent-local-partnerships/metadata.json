Shopify's ChatGPT integration is changing how products get discovered. What does this mean for brand activation?\n\nThe brands that win won't have the biggest ad budgets. They'll be the ones that show up where AI surfaces them. And local partners who solve real problems have an authentic advantage.\n\nhttps://smarttechinvest.com/blog/ai-intent-local-partnerships\n\n#BrandActivation #AIMarketing #LocalPartnerships #ConsumerIntent #RetailTech",
  "linkedinPersonalTeaser": "When a consumer types \"what's the best wet vac for cleaning sandy spots,\" who wins that search?\n\nNot whoever has the best SEO. Not whoever spent the most on ads.\n\nThe winner is whoever actually solves that specific, weird, deeply human problem.\n\nOmnicom's new Google partnership captures the actual questions people ask, not the sanitized keywords. Meanwhile, Shopify reports AI driven purchases grew 11x this year.\n\nConsumers don't think in keywords. They think in problems. And AI is getting better at capturing those problems before anyone in marketing sees them.\n\nLocal partners have an advantage here. They solve specific problems for specific communities. That's exactly the kind of signal AI is learning to prioritize.\n\nThe question isn't whether to invest in local activation. It's whether you can figure out which partners actually solve the problems your consumers are asking about.\n\nhttps://smarttechinvest.com/blog/ai-intent-local-partnerships\n\n#BrandStrategy #AIDiscovery #LocalActivation #ConsumerInsight"
