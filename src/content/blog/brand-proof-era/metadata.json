Now the moat is infrastructure.\n\nAmazon's redesigned Dash Cart isn't just retail tech - it's proof-building at the point of experience. Real-time savings trackers. Store navigation. Seamless Alexa integration.\n\nEvery feature proves what the brand promised.\n\nMeanwhile, Skift reports 34% of travelers now say credit card programs offer better rewards than airline or hotel loyalty. Why? Credit cards built better infrastructure, not better ads.\n\nThe shift is structural: 67% of consumers define brand trust through \"helping me solve problems\" rather than \"sharing my values.\"\n\nThe brands winning from here are building proof into every interaction.\n\n#BrandStrategy #RetailInnovation #CustomerExperience #ServiceDesign",
  "linkedinPersonalTeaser": "Amazon's new shopping cart tells you exactly how much you're saving in real-time.\n\nSeems like a small feature. But it's actually the whole game now.\n\nBrands used to compete on promises. Better messaging. Bigger cultural positioning. But something shifted - consumers started caring more about \"can you actually help me\" than \"do you share my values.\"\n\n67% now define trust that way, apparently.\n\nSo Amazon builds a cart that proves savings at the moment of experience. Credit cards build infrastructure that beats airline loyalty programs (34% of travelers now prefer them). Sephora builds AI that proves inclusive beauty instead of just claiming it.\n\nProof over promise. Infrastructure over messaging.\n\nWhat's the equivalent in your business - the thing that proves what you're promising?"
