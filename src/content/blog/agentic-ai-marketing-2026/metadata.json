Most are using it as a faster typewriter.\n\nThe real shift happening: AI agents that talk to each other.\n\nNBCU just announced AI agents are executing live sports ad buys across linear TV and streaming. Not suggesting buys. Executing them.\n\nThe gap between \"we use AI\" and \"AI makes us better\" keeps widening.\n\nNew analysis on what separates the leaders from the followers.\n\n#AgenticAI #MarketingStrategy #RetailTech #AIMarketing #MediaBuying",
  "linkedinPersonalTeaser": "Something weird is happening in marketing right now.\n\n86% adoption of AI tools. But most companies are just using it to make more stuff faster.\n\nMeanwhile, NBCU has AI agents executing live sports ad buys. Agent-to-agent. Humans just sign off.\n\nThe question for 2026 is not whether you use AI. It is whether AI changes how you think - or just makes you faster at thinking the same way.\n\nWhat is your honest assessment of where your org falls on that spectrum?"
