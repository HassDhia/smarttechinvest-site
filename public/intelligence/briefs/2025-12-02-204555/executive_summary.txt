You need to capture more early-value holiday buyers without blowing margin in the Nov 19 – Dec 03, 2025 window. Prioritize measured value: aim for **10–15%** foot-traffic uplift (stretch **≥25%**), lift early-window share from **12–15%** toward **20–30%**, and secure **≥5%** QR redemption of footfall while keeping event CPA at or below the desired ceiling. Favor a store-as-studio / media-led holiday approach with targeted thresholds and in-store QR offers; put CRM, Promotions, and Store Ops in a 30-day sprint to run a zip-coded threshold test and a store QR pilot, measure early-window share, incremental AOV, and event CPA vs baseline, and stop sitewide cuts that lower AOV. These moves focus scarce discounting where it converts and make early buyers measurable and accountable to margin [^5].
