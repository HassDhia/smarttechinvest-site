<h1>How to capture more early-value holiday buyers</h1>
<p><em>Lift early-window share without blowing margin in the Nov 19–Dec 03 window</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Run a focused flagship test to move early-window share toward <strong>20-30%</strong>, lift traffic, and protect margin; ask: approve the pilot and the CPA guardrail.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What we are seeing</h2>
<p>In one flagship signal, conditional threshold offers pulled earlier purchase timing while broad sitewide cuts depressed average order size. That odd, specific pattern generalizes: early buyers are value-first and respond to concentrated mechanics, not blanket price slashes. If we let broad cuts set price expectations now, we rebase the whole season and lose margin. So the operator problem is simple and urgent: capture those early-value buyers without teaching customers to expect lower prices everywhere.</p>
<h2>The move</h2>
<p>If you are running stores, do a two-week targeted threshold plus store-media QR test in one flagship during Nov 19–Dec 03 and watch three things: early-window share, QR redemption vs footfall, and event CPA. Use the store-as-studio / media-led holiday approach: place ZIP-coded thresholds and in-store QR offers that pay for measured visits and preserve AOV, and <strong>stop sitewide cuts</strong> that erode margin. Keep the finance guardrail in place so marketing can test reach without overrunning CPA. Run daily capture of footfall and redemptions and compare to baseline throughout the window.</p>
<h2>Size of prize</h2>
<p>A modest lift in early buyers changes staffing, inventory and promo math: a <strong>10-15%</strong> traffic uplift in the window translates to consistent extra visits during peak hours and noticeably healthier baskets at the registers. Moving early-window share to the 20–30% range will shift a share of holiday demand into measurable, margin-safe conversions rather than uncontrolled discounting. If QR drives even a small share of those visits you turn passive window shoppers into tracked buyers and make promo ROI actionable for the rest of the season.</p>
<h2>Risks</h2>
<p>The first thing that breaks is mix: thresholds can pull low-margin staples if creative is off; you will spot this in falling AOV and rising low-margin SKU share. The second risk is rebase: if offers leak online or across stores, you get price expectation drift; detect that by early-session AOV and cross-site redemption spread. Finally, loyalty-style multipliers can blow acquisition math; watch event CPA daily and stop the test if the guardrail is breached.</p>
<h2>Decision requested</h2>
<p>We are betting a targeted flagship sprint will prove we can shift customers earlier in the season without sacrificing margin by concentrating promo capital and measuring visits. I need retail to run the flagship and capture footfall and QR data, marketing to build the ZIP-coded thresholds and audience placement, partnerships to certify partner reporting, and finance to lock the CPA guardrail before funds deploy. Approve the two-week flagship pilot and lock the CPA guardrail and promo funds.</p>
<h3>Why this window matters</h3>
<ul>
<li>Early holiday buyers set public price expectation; acting now prevents season-long margin rebase.</li>
<li>Measured, conditional offers concentrate spend where it is incremental and protect average order value at scale.</li>
<li>Store-led QR and threshold mechanics convert offline footfall into accountable media outcomes you can scale or stop.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Targets for this pilot</h3>
<ul>
<li>Raise early-window purchase share to 20-30% during the Nov 19–Dec 03 two-week window.</li>
<li>Achieve QR redemptions of at least 5% of store footfall during the Nov 19–Dec 03 pilot (live + 7 days attribution).</li>
<li>Keep event CPA at or below 0.8x baseline across the Nov 19–Dec 03 pilot window.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Decision requested</h3>
<p>Approve the two-week flagship pilot and lock the CPA guardrail and promo funds.</p>
<p><em>Forward with subject: Pilot ask: two-week flagship threshold + QR test (Nov 19–Dec 03)</em></p>
