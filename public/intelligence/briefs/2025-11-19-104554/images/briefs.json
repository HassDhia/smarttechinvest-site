  "hero": "Cinematic dark scene: a brushed-steel stopwatch counts down in a shallow pool of light on a curtained studio table, negative space swallowing the edges — no text. Operators and studio collaborators lean in: two hands adjust curated high-ticket product boxes while a director gestures at a printed campaign spread; composition low-angle, oblique, materials: brushed metal, matte cardstock, velvet product surfaces, shallow depth of field. The image conveys the Nov 12 → Thanksgiving sprint (S1) and an AI‑segmented discount pilot rehearsal (S4) as a single time-boxed moment, moody rim light and grain amplifying urgency.",
  "hero_alt": "Low-angle dark studio scene with a brushed-steel stopwatch counting down on a table; operators' hands arrange curated high-ticket boxes and point at a printed campaign plan under moody rim light and deep shadows — no text.",
  "signal_map": "Top-down abstract signal map composed of concentric translucent rings—frosted glass and acrylic bands on a concrete pad—each band gesturing at operational levers (priority inventory sprint, flagship activations, AI segmentation) without any UI elements; strict overhead angle. The rings funnel into a single warm illuminated 'YES window' aperture at the center, using reflective materials and negative space to suggest focus and conversion (S1, S2, S4).",
  "signal_map_alt": "Overhead view of concentric frosted-glass and acrylic rings on concrete converging into a small warm 'YES window' aperture at center, implying targeted inventory sprint, in-store activations and AI segmentation; moody, text-free abstract vignette.",

    "Dusk exterior: flagship retail window shot at a 3/4 angle as deep twilight blues meet warm interior light; operators in coats arrange curated high-ticket displays in the glass window while a staffed activation appears as a pop-up inset inside, and a family bundle rests on a timber counter visible through the door — materials: glass, brass fixtures, timber; composition emphasizes reflective negative space and layered planes (S1, S2).",
    "Interior dusk vignette: through the storefront glass a pop-up inset shows a studio technologist and store manager collaborating over physical color swatches (analog of AI segments) beside stacked family bundles on a concrete counter; low-angle, cinematic backlight, hands in frame, materials include concrete, wool swatches and matte product boxes to signal an in-store pilot and measurement rehearsal (S4, S2)."
