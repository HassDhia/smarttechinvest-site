Design the in-store test to detect a 10–15% foot-traffic uplift versus baseline at flagged flagship locations tied to parade and Thanksgiving timing [^1][^5]. Set a test target to shift early-deal share roughly 5–10 percentage points above last year as shoppers move purchase intent earlier in the season [^3]. Over the next 30 days merch, store ops and analytics must lock priority inventory for high-ticket SKUs, finalize staffed activation and placement plans, and instrument weekly conversion, AOV and footfall metrics to run both the 6-week AI-segmented discount pilot and the broader 6–8 week verification plan [^3][^4][^8].",
