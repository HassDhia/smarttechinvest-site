Freepik / DC Studio Skift Take Hotels keep saying loyalty matters, but Accenture’s latest research suggests many brands in Asia Pacific still treat it like a dusty filing system for points rather than a living, breathing revenue engine. Share WhatsApp LinkedIn X Facebook Email What technological and operational barriers are preventing innovation in hotel loyalty and service in Asia Pacific? What is meant by the shift from 'rooms' to 'ecosystems' in the future of Asia Pacific hospitality? What changes do travelers in Asia Pacific expect from hotel loyalty programs today? Select a question above or ask something else Loyalty programs may be important growth drivers across the global hotel industry, but a new Accenture study says they’re not delivering much benefit in the Asia Pacific region. “Loyalty in Asia Pacific is still largely treated as a cost center, not a growth engine,” Emily Weiss, Accenture’s senior managing director and travel industry lead, told Skift. Weiss argued that loyalty design is out of touch with what guests now expect. “Travelers today want more than points, they want recognition, relevance, and rewards that fit their lives.” She said travelers expect instant gratification, with the ability to earn and redeem in the same moment “across everyday touchpoints.” According to the study, the region is slowly seeing a shift toward real-time benefits, faster rewards, and more partnerships outside the hotel stay. Weiss described how modern programs could look: “E Curated by Sean O'Neill Senior Hospitality Editor Early Check-In helps you keep up with the latest hotel and hospitality news.

Expectations are high. Learn the strategies that stop churn and keep customers engaged for the long haul. The Gist Loyalty is earned through experience. In the experience economy, retention comes from personalized, meaningful interactions—not transactional perks. Insights must translate into action. Marketing teams need aligned analytics, personalization and cross-functional execution to turn customer data into coordinated loyalty strategies. Experience drives measurable ROI. Brands delivering exceptional experiences retain up to 89% of customers, while poor performers keep just 4%, with loyalty-linked profitability gains of 25–95%. Loyalty requires an integrated foundation. The five pillars—behavioral segmentation, predictive health scoring, feedback loops, cross-functional alignment and AI-driven personalization—depend on unified customer data and connected systems. The definition of customer loyalty has evolved dramatically. It's no longer simply about repeat purchases or transaction frequency. Loyalty is built through meaningful interactions, personalized journeys and consistent value delivery at every touchpoint. Brands that understand this shift are investing in strategies that transform customers into advocates, while those clinging to transactional relationships find themselves increasingly vulnerable to competitive displacement. This post explores how marketing leaders can build lasting customer loyalty by embracing the dynamics of the experience economy and implementing strategies that prioritize customer success over short-term revenue extraction.

    "content": "The plunge — Greater Fool – Authored by Garth Turner – The Troubled Future of Real Estate Daily Weblog About Garth Turner Video Archive Contact Garth ← Down she goes Oh, no. → The plunge November 26th, 2025 | Book Updates | E-mail this blog post to a friend One thing the nihilists in the steerage section don’t get it that we’re dealing here with humans. People want stuff. Regardless of the economy, interest rates, reciprocal tariffs, the Epstein files or corruption in Ukraine. They want sex, kids and real estate – usually in that order. So the housing market woes that this pathetic blog has described in recent days cannot douse the smouldering desire to own property. Even when it’s a bizarre idea. That, of course, brings us to Kevin. Kevin here. I have been a silent blog dog for a few years, but today I’m here for some advice that I should probably already know the answer to… I am 32, single, living downtown Toronto, and renting a 1 bedroom loft at a comfy covid price of $2k/month. I work north of the city, in office full-time, and finally feel like MAYBE it’s time to grow up and move closer. I have my eye on a recently renovated, 3 bedroom, $1M listing in Bolton, that backs onto a forest. It was recently reduced from $1.28M. I have an income of $180k salary, and the potential to earn a significant bonus. I have $320K invested, for which I would consider withdrawing $250K to put down. Looking for some honest advice on what to do next, and I can’t think of anyone better to get that from than you (and maybe the comments). Bad idea, Kev. Coming here for advice, we mean. There is only heartbreak and humiliation ahead. First, understand there’s a reason the dude in Bolton (a Bunnypatch town an hour’s drive from the Big Smoke, up the Escarpment into the snow belt with coyotes and bears) has reduced the ask by a quarter million dollars. There are no buyers at the moment. There is little appetite for hick towns where Covid pricing wiped away the one advantage they posed – cheap living. And economic uncertainty stalks the land. In other words, buying today – even at this ‘discount’ from ridiculous valuation – might not bring any capital gain for years to come. Second, is this really a good time to drain your precious portfolio by 80% just so you can go deeply into debt and seriously increase your living costs? As we’re about to show you, the days of saving heaps of your take-home income will be over, pronto, if you make this move. And, third, you’d better love Bolton. Like, a lot. For a very long time. Because you might be captive there, after trading your freedom, flexibility and mobility for a mortgage and a property that could be just as hard to sell in the future as the current dude is discovering now. So are you the greater fool? Let’s do the math. If you buy for a million, you must also add in land transfer tax (even after the first-time buyer discount), legals (make sure you buy title insurance) and a few bucks for closing costs. That comes to $18,000. Deducting the hefty $250,000 deposit (and there will likely be capital gains taxes to pay as you eviscerate the investment portfolio), that leaves a mortgage of just under $770,000. Plus, you’ll need a lot more furniture than sits in your loft. Budget for that. Ownership costs will include the mortgage payment, which is $4,343 at the current five-year fixed rate. You’ll need about $300 a month for house insurance, plus property tax in the Town of Caledon (where Bolton lives) will be $743 a month on a million-dollar assessment. Now you’ve also got to factor in the deposit. After all, a quarter million dollars should earn at least 6% (in reality, much more lately). So by throwing it against the property, you have an opportunity cost of $1,250 a month. Add it all up, Kevin. Yes, it’s $6,636 a month, which is more than three times what you pay now. The immense ownership premium of $4,600 a month means an annual cost exceeding $55,000 – in after-tax income. But, Kev cries in pained reb",

Everyone harbors a secret love for discovering incredible deals. The white facade of Deseret Industries stands like a beacon of bargain hope against Utah’s blue sky. Treasure hunters, your mothership has landed! Photo Credit: Michael There’s something deeply satisfying about the treasure hunt experience, that moment when your heart skips a beat after spotting the perfect item with an astonishingly small price tag. It’s comparable to hitting a small jackpot, except instead of collecting cash, you’re bringing home a nearly-new food processor that someone received as an unwanted housewarming gift. The Logan Deseret Industries stands tall as a testament to our bargain-seeking nature. From the exterior, it presents a clean, spacious facade with distinctive blue and red signage that signals to savvy Utah shoppers: prepare for your wallet to heave a sigh of relief. As you make your approach to the entrance, you’ll notice the continuous flow of community members arriving and departing – some dropping off boxes of donations, others exiting with shopping carts heaped with newfound gems. It’s a remarkable cycle of community recycling, a sustainable exchange that surges every time a popular home organization show inspires another wave of closet purging. Blue skies and bargains await! The distinctive blue and red signage has become a beacon of hope for budget-conscious shoppers across Utah. Photo Credit: Calvin Lujan Push through those sliding doors and immediately you’ll be struck by the impressive vastness of the establishment. This isn’t some cramped vintage boutique where you must navigate sideways between tightly packed merchandise. This is thrifting elevated to warehouse scale – an expansive treasure repository with spacious walkways and clearly designated departments that would impress even the most dedicated organization enthusiasts. The illumination throughout is bright yet comfortable – ideal for detecting that tiny coffee stain on an otherwise flawless shirt or examining the detailed workmanship on a piece of glassware that might be a valuable collectible or possibly just a promotional item from a mid-2000s restaurant chain. At these prices, such mysteries become affordable gambles. The clothing department extends before you like a fabric sea, organized waves of textiles arranged by category, dimension, and occasionally by hue. Men’s, women’s, children’s – all thoughtfully arranged and continuously replenished by industrious staff members who somehow maintain remarkable order despite the constant stream of incoming donations. A thrifter’s paradise stretches before you—racks upon racks of possibilities where yesterday’s castoffs become tomorrow’s conversation pieces. Photo Credit: Brandon Wallace What distinguishes Deseret Industries from typical secondhand shops is their commitment to quality standards. Merchandise here typically appears in better condition than comparable offerings elsewhere. This isn’t to guarantee you won’t occasionally encounter a cardigan with mysterious marks or a coffee mug commemorating someone else’s high school reunion in Cedar City from 2008, but generally speaking, the inventory presents as clean and well-maintained.

The iconic blue and white signage stands out along Main Avenue, a beacon for bargain hunters and sustainability-minded South Dakotans alike. The unassuming exterior of Goodwill in Brookings hides a treasure trove within. Like a thrift store speakeasy, you need to know what awaits inside. Photo Credit: Bde269 I’ve long maintained that life’s most interesting finds aren’t in glossy storefronts but in places with character, history, and perhaps a thin layer of nostalgic dust—precisely what defines Goodwill of the Great Plains in Brookings. This isn’t your average thrift store; it’s a beloved destination where people from across the state converge to experience the ultimate treasure hunt. Allow me to guide you through this unassuming building where sustainability meets affordability, where each purchase carries its own unique history, and where—I kid you not—lucky shoppers occasionally score designer items for less than the cost of a decent cup of coffee. The modest exterior with its functional metal facade might not immediately suggest “premier shopping experience,” but appearances can be delightfully deceiving. What lies beyond those front doors at 625 Main Avenue is a meticulously arranged universe of potential just waiting to be explored. Stepping into Goodwill of the Great Plains feels remarkably like entering an eclectic museum where every single item carries both a price tag and a story. Bright overhead lighting illuminates row upon row of clothing, household goods, furniture pieces, literary works, and electronics—all patiently awaiting their second chapter in someone else’s life. Under clear South Dakota skies, this unassuming storefront houses a universe of possibilities where yesterday’s castoffs become tomorrow’s conversation pieces. Photo Credit: christian alexander oropeza There’s an undeniable electricity in the air when you first cross the threshold, a tingling sense that today could be the day you discover that perfect something you never realized you were missing. The atmosphere carries distinctive notes of vintage fabrics, well-loved books, and infinite possibility. Unlike conventional retail establishments with their predictable stock, this Goodwill location boasts an inventory that transforms daily, sometimes changing dramatically within hours. Items that don’t find homes in larger markets might journey to Brookings, creating a perpetually evolving merchandise landscape that inspires devoted shoppers to visit with almost religious regularity. The phrase “you never know what you’ll find” isn’t marketing fluff here—it’s the fundamental principle that drives the entire operation. I observed a young university student practically dancing with joy after finding a fully functional coffee machine for just $7, enthusiastically explaining how he’d been surviving on instant coffee packets in his dormitory. Not far away, an elderly woman carefully inspected a collection of classic Pyrex mixing bowls, her knowledgeable gaze checking for imperfections before triumphantly adding them to her shopping cart. The seasonal window art transforms with the calendar—purple bats and cheerful pumpkins announce that Halloween treasures await inside. Photo Credit: Marika ",
