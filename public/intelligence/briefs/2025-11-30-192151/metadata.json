Favor a store-as-studio / media-led holiday with brand collabs timed to Black Friday weekend, and within 30 days marketing, store ops, and partnerships must reallocate planned loyalty discount spend into in-store activations, local media/creator slots, and POS event attribution [^1][^3]. Measure success daily via buyer activity share vs promo intensity and confirm QR redemption at **≥5%** of footfall to validate discovery-to-buy conversion [^1].",
