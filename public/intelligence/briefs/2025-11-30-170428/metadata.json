    "Micro-creators within a five-mile radius convert local followers into on-foot visits by producing shoppable short-form content tied to drops.",

  "executive_summary": "You need to drive measurable local foot traffic and higher-value buyer share from the micro-communities immediately outside flagship doors without escalating blanket discounting in the next 6 weeks. Store-as-studio activations can deliver **10-15%** foot-traffic uplift (stretch ≥25%) and move early-window share from current 12-15% toward **20-30%**, while keeping event CPA at or below **0.80×** baseline if QR redemption hits at least **5%** of footfall. Favor a store-as-studio / media-led holiday approach over a discount-heavy holiday and, in the next 30 days, have Partnerships, Retail Ops and Marketing run a 4–6 week pilot recruiting micro-creators within a five-mile radius, reserve creator-assigned inventory, and instrument unique QR/UTMs plus same-day POS tags to trace conversions. Measure success by the foot-traffic uplift and early-window buyer share targets above and by event CPA versus baseline so you can stop or scale within one cycle [^4][^5][^6].",

    "Instrument attribution: add same-day POS flags for creator-driven purchases, deploy unique codes per creator/event, and dashboard footfall uplift vs promo intensity.",
    "Set CPA and redemption guardrails: pause scale if event CPA exceeds 0.80× baseline or if QR redemption is below 5% of footfall."
