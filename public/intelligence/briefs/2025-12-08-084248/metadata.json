    "Visible discounts concentrate planned full-price purchases into short promo windows; this raises conversion but lowers per-buyer margin and early-window durable demand.",
    "Shallow, partner-funded activations and studio weekends move foot traffic with less cannibalization than broad markdowns when measured by new-vs-repeat cohort margin and QR-redemption share.",
    "Dynamic one-day flash pricing tied to competitor checks can cut event CPA toward the **\u22640.80\u00d7** ceiling if discount scope and SKU depth are tightly controlled."
  ],
  "executive_summary": "You need to capture December sales without eroding margin by leaning into collaborations and timed value rather than blanket discounts in the Nov 24 - Dec 08, 2025 window. Target lifting early-window share from **12-15%** toward **20-30%** while driving **10-15%** foot-traffic uplift (stretch **\u226525%**), keeping event CPA at or below **\u22640.80\u00d7** baseline and securing QR redemptions of **\u22655%** of footfall to prove non-markdown acquisition value [^1][^3]. In the next 30 days prioritize a collab-led and store-as-studio approach: run two partner pop-ups plus one media-funded weekend studio activation, instrument per-SKU sell-through, cohort margin, and QR redemption, and assign Marketing to own pop-ups and Store Ops to own in-store activations so you can stop mass markdowns if contribution margin collapses [^1][^7].",

    "Run two collaborator pop-up weekends and one store-as-studio media activation in the Nov 24 - Dec 08 window; require partner media funding and a QR offer that must hit **\u22655%** redemption of footfall.",
    "Deploy a one-day dynamic flash price test for targeted SKUs with real-time competitor-price checks owned by E-comm; cap depth per SKU and measure event CPA against the **\u22640.80\u00d7** baseline.",
    "Instrument per-SKU sell-through, contribution margin by cohort (new vs repeat), early-window share, and per-visitor yield; pause mass markdowns if contribution margin falls below target thresholds."
