# Catch December Demand Without Deeper Markdowns
_Use partner pop-ups and timed value in Nov 24–Dec 08 to shift sales earlier while protecting margin._

> We can move meaningful December demand into the Nov 24–Dec 08 window and avoid a markdown spiral; ask: approve a two-week, four-store pilot and one-day e-comm flash.

One oddly specific signal: in similar activations QR offers convert from about five percent of visitors and under-30 conversion ticks up when a pop-up is right in the flow. Broader evidence points to a compressed buying window this season — customers are hunting bargains earlier and in concentrated bursts. That behavior makes blanket discounts tempting but dangerous for contribution margin. The operator problem is simple: capture that early demand with value that does not turn into a markdown treadmill.

If you run stores, try a two-week, four-store test in the Nov 24–Dec 08 window that pairs a one-day e-commerce dynamic flash with two collaborator pop-ups and two partner-funded store studio weekends. Use a collab-led and store-as-studio approach so Marketing owns partner curation and Store Ops owns in-store theatrics; Performance Marketing keeps paid CPA near baseline. Instrument per-SKU sell-through, cohort margin, and QR redemption so we can spot cannibalization fast. Measure success by holding event CPA under the ceiling while shifting share into the early window.

Right now early demand sits around **12-15%** of December sales. If we move that to **20-30%** the effect is visible at the register: full carts earlier in the season, fewer clearance lines, and marketing spend that acquires new or reactivated customers rather than harvesting existing ones. Foot traffic lifts of **10-15%** during activations feel like a packed Saturday without forcing deeper price cuts. The upside is simple: sell more at higher contribution and keep markdowns as a last resort.

The first thing that breaks is full-price cannibalization — collaborations can shift purchases from full price days into our events without net new demand. The next failure mode is margin cliff from depth of offer; we will notice this as per-order margin slipping past the guardrail in daily reports. A competitive price-match spiral is possible if key SKUs look promotional; watch competitor feeds and SKU-level sell-through. Finally, activations can drive traffic without converting; QR redemption and cohort buy-rate will show that gap immediately.

The bet: run a focused Nov 24–Dec 08, two-week pilot that proves we can grow early-window share with partners while capping CPA and margin impact. I want Marketing to own pop-up curation, Store Ops to run studio weekends, Performance Marketing to hold event CPA near baseline, and Finance to monitor per-order margin daily. Approve the two-week Nov 24–Dec 08 pilot and assign Marketing to run pop-ups and Store Ops to run studio activations.

What matters in this window is Consumers are concentrating purchases earlier; capturing that demand now prevents a deeper markdown cycle later across the whole season., Partner-funded activations reduce direct promo spend and provide measurable incremental reach that performance channels rarely buy cheaply right before holiday peaks., and Short, visible events create reasons for store visits that are harder for competitors to replicate with pure price cuts and open a path to retention.

Keep an eye on: Shift early-window sales share from current baseline to 20-30% within the Nov 24–Dec 08, 2025 window (two-week test).; Deliver foot-traffic uplift of 10-15% during activations within the two-week pilot window and monitor stretch toward 25% in the same period.; Secure QR redemptions at or above 5% of footfall within the Nov 24–Dec 08 window to prove non-markdown acquisition value.

If that resonates, Approve the two-week Nov 24–Dec 08 pilot and assign Marketing to run pop-ups and Store Ops to run studio activations.

_Forward with subject: Approve: Two-week Nov 24–Dec 08 pop-up + studio pilot to protect margin_
