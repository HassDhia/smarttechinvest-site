You need to capture December sales without eroding margin by leaning into collaborations and timed value rather than blanket discounts in the Nov 24 - Dec 08, 2025 window. Target lifting early-window share from **12-15%** toward **20-30%** while driving **10-15%** foot-traffic uplift (stretch **≥25%**), keeping event CPA at or below **≤0.80×** baseline and securing QR redemptions of **≥5%** of footfall to prove non-markdown acquisition value [^1][^3]. In the next 30 days prioritize a collab-led and store-as-studio approach: run two partner pop-ups plus one media-funded weekend studio activation, instrument per-SKU sell-through, cohort margin, and QR redemption, and assign Marketing to own pop-ups and Store Ops to own in-store activations so you can stop mass markdowns if contribution margin collapses [^1][^7].
