Recent signals show a sharp bifurcation: AI-native, always-on agent platforms (autonomous cybersecurity, workflow and CX agents) are gaining pricing power, enterprise adoption and investor capital, while commodity sectors and expeditionary defense initiatives face headwinds from tariffs and weak troop commitments. Operators should treat action-capable, 24/7 agents as platform shifts: redesign workflow engines for durable state, enforce least-privilege, instrument immutable audit trails, and run staged pilots with tight rollback and human-in-the-loop gating to limit blast radius. Investors should prioritize firms with measurable ROI, recurring SLAs, compliance certifications (ISO 27001, SOC 2, HIPAA options), and scalable inference stacks; favor infrastructure plays (accelerators, hybrid cloud, observability) and reprice exposure to tariff-exposed commodities and troop-dependent contractors. Business development must sell outcomes, pursue regulated vertical pilots, partner with MSSPs/SIs, and bundle trade-compliance and logistics solutions for tariff-impacted customers. Immediate actions: deploy narrow autonomous workflows for low-risk, high-frequency use cases; obtain certifications and strong auditability to accelerate procurement; optimize models and hardware for 24/7 inference economics; and pivot defense sales toward non-combat cyber, ISR and training services. These moves capture upside from automation while mitigating geopolitical and supply-chain risk. Prioritize certified pilots, partner with cloud and hardware vendors, and monitor policy shifts closely for strategic positioning.
