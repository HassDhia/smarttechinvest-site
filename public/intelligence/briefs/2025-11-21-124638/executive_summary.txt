This unified holiday target pack aims for detectable foot-traffic uplift **10–15%** (stretch goal **≥25%** in top markets), early-window transaction share **20–30%** (vs ~12–15% baseline), event CPA **≤0.80×** baseline, and QR/scan redemption **≥5%** of footfall. We will test an early-access A/B inside the same two-week window: Arm A legacy markdown vs Arm B bundle+GWP+loyalty to see which preserves margin while driving early-window share. Operators and brand partners must, within **30 days**, stand up A/B holdouts, instrument door counts and QR→POS attribution, lock two-week launch windows, and align staffing, fulfillment and loyalty incentives for rapid measurement and optimization [^3][^1].
