    "prompt": "Capture Compressed holiday windows layered together: a short, high‑intensity brand test (S1) overlapping a retailer's shorter entry window (S2) and a tech-enabled instant reward cadence (S3) — depict competing measurement horizons and the decision to prioritize cadence vs. reach.. Scene: Studio backlot staged as a pop-up mockup: matte wood counter, brushed steel racks, translucent signage panels; 3/4 angle, medium distance to show collaboration and context.. Persona: Brand operations lead and studio producer collaborating with a visual merch assistant (operator + studio crew).. Action: Hands and bodies aligning printed floor plans, loyalty tokens, and sample offer cards; studio lead adjusts a directional light ribbon to suggest test cadence without showing UI.. Urgency symbol: Converging light bands and narrowing ribbons of highlight that imply differing window lengths and pulse rates (symbolic timing, no clocks).. Key objects: printed loyalty cards and enrollment tokens (physical mockups), stacked paper SMS/reward slips (abstract, not showing screens), sample BNPL token slips and coupon tags. Lighting: Polished editorial lighting with confident highlights, subtle rim light, and clean negative space for copy or overlays.. Mood: Precise, collaborative, confident — controlled urgency.. Props: printed loyalty cards and enrollment tokens (physical mockups), stacked paper SMS/reward slips (abstract, not showing screens), sample BNPL token slips and coupon tags. polished editorial photography, clean gradients, confident highlights, single clear subject, generous negative space, modern materials, daylight optimism, not a poster, not a collage, not an infographic, no charts, no UI, no labels",
