  "executive_summary": "Parade-linked in-store activations should be run as a measured test, with a target to detect a 10–15% foot-traffic uplift versus baseline at the flagship during the activation window [^1][^5]. Design the Early Holiday vs Black Friday A/B test to detect a 15–25% increase in early-deal share year-over-year and track margin-per-order to measure tradeoffs [^3][^4]. In the next 30 days merchandising, store operations, analytics and fulfillment must agree the two-arm test plan (Nov 12–30), reserve flagship inventory and live-stream capacity, instrument daily KPIs (footfall, conversion, margin, SLA) and stand up a daily reporting cadence [^1][^3][^4]. [^1][^3][^4][^5]",

    "Launch the two-arm A/B test (Nov 12–30): instrument daily conversion, margin-per-order, days-of-supply and customer-contact volume.",
    "Execute one parade-linked flagship activation (live stream + exclusive SKU/experience) and treat other flagships as controls for footfall comparison.",
    "Reallocate inventory and schedule fulfillment staffing to support front-loaded demand; lock reporting owners and a 7-day cadence for the test period."
