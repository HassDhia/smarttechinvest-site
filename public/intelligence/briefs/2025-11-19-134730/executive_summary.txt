Parade-linked in-store activations should be run as a measured test, with a target to detect a 10–15% foot-traffic uplift versus baseline at the flagship during the activation window [^1][^5]. Design the Early Holiday vs Black Friday A/B test to detect a 15–25% increase in early-deal share year-over-year and track margin-per-order to measure tradeoffs [^3][^4]. In the next 30 days merchandising, store operations, analytics and fulfillment must agree the two-arm test plan (Nov 12–30), reserve flagship inventory and live-stream capacity, instrument daily KPIs (footfall, conversion, margin, SLA) and stand up a daily reporting cadence [^1][^3][^4].
