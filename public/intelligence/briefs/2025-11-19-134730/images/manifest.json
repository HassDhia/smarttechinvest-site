Lighting: Polished editorial lighting with confident highlights on hands and cards, soft fill to preserve clean negative space.. Mood: Precise, collaborative, composed confidence.. Props: tiered offer cards (Nov 12–30) that read as tactile swatches, sample SKU pack (flagship item), laminated fulfillment checklist, studio headset folded on the table. polished editorial photography, clean gradients, confident highlights, single clear subject, generous negative space, modern materials, not a poster, not a collage, not an infographic, no charts, no UI, no labels",
