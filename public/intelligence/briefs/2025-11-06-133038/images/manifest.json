Shallow depth-of-field and generous negative space frame the device as a visual proxy for algorithmic mediation, AI-driven content farms and social media platforms, suggesting industrialized transmission infrastructure that routinizes influence.. clean editorial photography, soft daylight, cool slate/steel palette, no text or lettering, single subject, generous negative space, magazine cover aesthetic, depth-of-field, subtle contrast, not a poster, not a collage, not an infographic, no charts, no UI, no labels",
