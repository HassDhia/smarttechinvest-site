    "Pilot target pack: **10–15%** footfall lift, **20–30%** early-window share, **≤0.80×** event CPA, **≥5%** QR redemption of footfall [^2].",
    "A/B test design: Arm A legacy markdown vs Arm B bundle+GWP+loyalty run in the same two-week window to measure CPA compression and transaction timing [^6][^9].",

  "executive_summary": "What is happening: operators are moving stores from pure retail to content-first holiday pilots that pair limited early-access windows with bundled offers, turning attention into measurable transactions [^1][^2]. Why it matters: the unified holiday target pack is explicit — detectable foot-traffic uplift **10–15%** (stretch **≥25%** in top markets), early-window transaction share **20–30%** (vs ~12–15% baseline), event CPA target **≤0.80×** baseline, and QR/scan redemption **≥5%** of footfall [^2][^7]. The A/B framing is essential: Arm A runs legacy markdowns and Arm B runs bundle+GWP+loyalty inside the same two-week window to isolate the lift signal and CPA compression [^6][^9]. What operators should do in the next 30 days: **assign a single owner**, lock a flagship pilot, instrument door counts and QR→POS link, configure A/B holdouts, and align marketing, store ops, data/CRM, and property on reporting cadence [^9][^7]. ### Quick Scanners",
  "top_operator_moves": [
    "Immediate: Lock one flagship site, publish the two-week early-access window, and **assign a single measurement owner** to run daily footfall and transaction checks.",
    "Quarter-scale: Execute the Arm A vs Arm B A/B with spatial holdouts and standardized bundles/GWP, then reprice markdowns only after a winner emerges.",
    "Long-tail: Convert repeat pop-up wins into a calendar of branded content sessions and shared property partnerships to institutionalize audience-driven demand."
