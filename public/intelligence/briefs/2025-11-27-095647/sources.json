Credit: ThoughtPoet for Chicago Reader City of Win is a series curated by Isiah “ThoughtPoet” Veney and written by Joshua Eferighe that uses prose and photography to create portraits of Chicago musicians and cultural innovators working to create positive change in their communities. Jasir Bailey is likely the youngest owner of a storefront business in Hyde Park—he turned 22 on October 10, the day before a ribbon-cutting ceremony for his streetwear brand, Stockboy . He sees Stockboy as more than a clothing shop—it’s a multidisciplinary space for creatives to bring their visions to life. Bailey is changing the brand’s name from Stockboy Chicago to Stockboy Studios, which he says more accurately represents the role the shop is filling for the people who love it. “I decided to go with Stockboy Studios, because it’s literally like a studio,” he explains. “It’s people that come in here that do video and photography projects; people have sat for hours painting art. People come in here, and we print their shirts. We do DJ sets in here; we do everything. So it’s literally a studio, and gives me an excuse to leave the store a little messy, because it’s showing that I’m working on stuff.” In less than two months, Jasir has repeatedly demonstrated his vision for the space. Longtime south-side rapper Adamn Killa—who’s gone viral with the “Arrest me, daddy!” bit he’s been using to promote his song “Fall On”— held a meet and greet at Stockboy on November 20 that drew a line down the block. On Halloween, up-and-coming fashion designer Exavier Rodriguez held a pop-up release for a new Cult collection in the space, and Jasir says the 312 Collective has booked Stockboy for a creative networking mixer on November 26. Born in West Humboldt Park, Bailey grew up there and in Bronzeville. He attended Kenwood Academy from 12 to 16, at which point he moved in with his dad, Howard Bailey, in West Englewood. He now lives in Woodlawn. Bailey has been working in the world of clothing since age 13, and he says he already has a plan to provide his customers the resources to realize their own DIY projects. He sees the Chicago streetwear scene as lacking this kind of infrastructure for grassroots creativity. “I’m just trying to bring coolness to Chicago,” Bailey says. “I feel like Chicago is really talented but not cool. You look at LA and New York—they really think outside the",

The business has evolved from maintaining buildings and collecting rent to curating experiences, building communities and creating environments where people want to stay longer and come back often. This is the new reality of retail that Evan Walke , Cushman & Wakefield's managing director and national retail lead for its Asset Services group, is seeing. Walke said this evolution is accelerating as mixed-use developments combine retail, multifamily, office and entertainment into a single, dynamic ecosystem. “At Cushman & Wakefield, we’re seeing firsthand how these changes are reshaping what clients expect from their property management teams and how our approach is adapting to meet that moment,” he said. From Managing Space to Managing Experience Traditional retail property management was largely transactional: Keep the lights on, collect the rent and manage maintenance. Today, retail is increasingly experiential. Shoppers expect activation and engagement, from pop-up markets and public art to digital touchpoints that extend beyond the walls of the property. “For property managers, that means shifting from operational oversight to experience orchestration,” Walke said. “Every decision, from how common areas are programmed to how tenants are supported on the marketing front, helps define the overall brand of the property.” That’s why Cushman & Wakefield created a dedicated Asset Services group. The goal is to bring specialized expertise to an asset class that requires a distinct operational mindset. “Retail is public-facing, fast-moving, and deeply dependent on the success of its tenants,” he said. “The work doesn’t end when a lease is signed – it begins. Helping tenants open faster, perform better and stay connected with customers is now a core part of the job.” The New Shape of Retail: Mixed-Use and Reimagined Malls Across the country, traditional malls and suburban shopping centers are being reinvented. Owners are transforming underperforming assets into vibrant mixed-use communities that bring shopping, dining, living and working together in one connected ",

Those looking for value stocks to add to their portfolio may want to use this list as a starting point for further investment research. Why Focus on Undervalued Household Durables Stocks? Value investors seek to buy stocks at a discount to their intrinsic value. Long-term returns show that such strategies are advantageous. Value stocks, as a group, tend to outperform growth stocks over extended periods of time. Typically, value investors perform financial analysis of numerous metrics, don’t follow the herd and are long-term investors. AAII’s A+ Investor Value Grade is derived from a stock’s Value Score. The Value Score is the percentile rank of the average of the percentile ranks of the price-to-sales ratio, price-earnings ratio, enterprise-value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio, shareholder yield, price-to-book-value ratio and price-to-free-cash-flow ratio. The score is variable, meaning it can consider all six ratios or, should any of the six ratios not be valid, the remaining ratios that are valid. To be assigned a Value Score, stocks must have a valid (non-null) ratio a",

The remnants of the Burberry that once occupied the space can still be seen, including dressing rooms and ample storage once home to clothes and merchandise. Now, that storage houses art supplies and drying work. Bisnow/Taylor Driscoll Artist Kris Shaffer's studio space at Zero Empty Spaces' Natick Mall location in Massachusetts. ZES co-founders Evan Snow and Andrew Martineau started the company in 2019, first leasing vacant retail space in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The Massachusetts studio was the Florida-based company’s first out-of-state location in 2022. Since then, the company has transformed 33 retail locations into studios totaling 150K SF in partnership with 22 real estate companies. Not all of the spaces leased have been in high-end shopping centers. ZES seeks to fill space where retail vacancies are high but affordable studio vacancies are low. \"We've been in everything from three-level retail malls, office buildings, pad sites, former Payless shoe stores, banks,\" Snow said. \"It doesn't have to be a vanilla box.\" In addition to Massachusetts, ZES operates in Florida and Virginia. On average, the spaces ZES leases stay filled from 24 to 36 months. Artists pay roughly $300 per month for shared studio space. The value proposition Snow and Martineau offer landlords is ZES art studios can fill and revitalize vacant retail space, driving foot traffic and attracting attention to potential tenants. Of the 33 locations Martineau and Snow opened, 25 have since been leased by permanent tenants. ZES began to operate during one of the bleakest times for retail space in U.S. history, the coronavirus pandemic. Roughly 12,200 stores closed in 2020, leaving behind 159M SF of vacant retail space, according to CoStar . For many landlords, filling up this empty space was a challenge as retail growth only ticked up 0.4% at the end of that year.
