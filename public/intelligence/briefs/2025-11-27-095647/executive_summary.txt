What is happening: operators are moving stores from pure retail to content-first holiday pilots that pair limited early-access windows with bundled offers, turning attention into measurable transactions [^1][^2]. Why it matters: the unified holiday target pack is explicit — detectable foot-traffic uplift **10–15%** (stretch **≥25%** in top markets), early-window transaction share **20–30%** (vs ~12–15% baseline), event CPA target **≤0.80×** baseline, and QR/scan redemption **≥5%** of footfall [^2][^7]. The A/B framing is essential: Arm A runs legacy markdowns and Arm B runs bundle+GWP+loyalty inside the same two-week window to isolate the lift signal and CPA compression [^6][^9]. What operators should do in the next 30 days: **assign a single owner**, lock a flagship pilot, instrument door counts and QR→POS link, configure A/B holdouts, and align marketing, store ops, data/CRM, and property on reporting cadence [^9][^7]. ### Quick Scanners
