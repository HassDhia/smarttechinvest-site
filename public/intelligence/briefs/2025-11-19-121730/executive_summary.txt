Run an 8-week rolling test that combines early-November ‘first look’ member drops with a single parade/Thanksgiving-week flagship activation to compare conversion, AOV, and earned coverage week‑by‑week [^4][^1]. Design the test to detect an 8–15% foot‑traffic uplift versus baseline during event/flagship weeks, using pop‑up and parade benchmarks as a guide [^2][^5]. Treat a 5–12% increase in early‑deal share versus last year as an observed target for member‑first promotions and early discounts, and measure margin impact across the two promo phases [^4][^3]. In the next 30 days merchandising, store operations, and comms must agree on the SKU test set, lock the flagship date/partner, instrument footfall and conversion tracking, and schedule the email/member flows for the first‑look drop [^4][^1].
