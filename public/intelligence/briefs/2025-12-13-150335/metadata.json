  "executive_summary": "You need to capture high-value holiday buyers with local partnerships between Nov 29 and Dec 13 without turning every activation into a headline discount race. This matters because front-loaded, collab-led activations can lift foot traffic from a base **10\u201315%** toward a stretch of **\u226525%**, increase early-window share from **12\u201315%** to **20\u201330%**, and keep event CPA at or below **0.80\u00d7 baseline** when discount depth is controlled [^7][^2]. Over the next 30 days, launch a **20\u2010store** Nov 29\u2013Dec 13 exclusive drop with one brand partner owned by Head of Retail and Head of Partnerships, and measure early-window share, event CPA and QR redemption against matched controls daily to decide scale and spend.",

    "Run a 20\u2010store exclusive in-store drop Nov 29\u2013Dec 13 with one brand partner; set the KPI: early-window share **20\u201330%** and lock assortment to high-margin SKUs.",
    "Deploy QR-tagged offers and content in every pilot store and instrument QR redemption against footfall, aiming for **\u22655%** redemption to validate in-store attribution.",
    "Produce three store-as-studio shoots in high-traffic pilot stores, report buyer activity share vs promo intensity daily, and withhold paid amplification until organic signals meet thresholds."
