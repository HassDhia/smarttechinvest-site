  "abstract": "You need to capture high-value holiday buyers with local partnerships between Nov 29 and Dec 13 without turning every activation into a headline discount race. This matters because front-loaded, collab-led activations can lift foot traffic from a base **10–15%** toward a stretch of **≥25%**, increase early-window share from **12–15%** to **20–30%**, and keep event CPA at or below **0.80× baseline** when discount depth is controlled [^7][^2]. Over the next 30 days, launch a **20‐store** Nov 29–Dec 13 exclusive drop with one brand partner owned by Head of Retail and Head of Partnerships, and measure early-window share, event CPA and QR redemption against matched controls daily to decide scale and spend.",
