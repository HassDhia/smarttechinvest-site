Run tightly timed early-access and pop‑up activations with a unified holiday target pack — detectable foot‑traffic uplift 10–15% (stretch ≥25% in top markets), early‑window transaction share 20–30% (vs ~12–15% baseline), event CPA ≤0.80× baseline, and QR/scan redemption ≥5% of footfall. Test the offer architecture as an A/B within the same two‑week window (Arm A: legacy percent markdown vs Arm B: bundle + gift‑with‑purchase + instant loyalty credit) to isolate margin and loyalty effects. Over the next 30 days collaboration teams must lock windows and site lists, prepare inventory/bundle and GWP SKUs, instrument door‑counts, QR→POS linkage and A/B assignment IDs, schedule staff/fulfillment, and finalize measurement cohorts for 6–8 week post‑visit followup [^1][^3].
