    "prompt": "Capture Concentrate two high‑intensity activation windows and choose between value‑exchange offers — the visual tension is between focused, limited-time concentration and the operator's decision to allocate resources for hire/lift vs. margin preservation.. Scene: Indoor retail pop‑up workspace (three‑quarter view) — laminated campaign boards on a timber table, a blurred storefront in the background, clean negative space to the right for copy.. Persona: Operator (store manager) and studio lead (event/creative producer) collaborating shoulder‑to‑shoulder; both mid‑action.. Action: One hand places two stacked activation cards (Black Friday / Dec 1–14) while the other sorts three offer samples (donation sleeve, wrapped GWP token, instant points card) on textured paper — angled low to emphasize hands and materials.. Urgency symbol: Converging beams of light that create a narrow, bright corridor on the table surface — symbolic focus that suggests a tight, limited window rather than a literal clock.. Key objects: laminated activation cards labeled by window (paper, matte), three tangible offer samples: donation envelope (kraft), gift sample (fabric ribbon), points token (metallic chip), printed A/B test assignment cards (tabbed), small cohort tracking ledger (handwritten). Lighting: Polished editorial lighting with confident highlights on hands and materials; soft falloff into deep, clean negative space.. Mood: Precise, collaborative, confident — tension is purposeful and solution‑seeking.. Props: laminated activation cards labeled by window (paper, matte), three tangible offer samples: donation envelope (kraft), gift sample (fabric ribbon), points token (metallic chip), printed A/B test assignment cards (tabbed), small cohort tracking ledger (handwritten). polished editorial photography, clean gradients, confident highlights, single clear subject, generous negative space, modern materials, not a poster, not a collage, not an infographic, no charts, no UI, no labels",

    "prompt": "Scene: Busy store floor during a concentrated window (three‑quarter view, medium focal length) — pop‑up kiosks aligned along a corridor, textured floor reflections, branded tent cards visible but no screens.. Moment: Operator pins A/B assignment tabs to two kiosks (one running instant points, one running a discount variant) while an analyst reviews a small printed cohort snapshot; camera angle slightly elevated to capture both action and kiosk layout.. Persona: Store manager and operations analyst collaborating in‑scene; manager is arranging physical offer material while analyst holds a data printout.. Mood: Decisive, analytical, outcomes‑driven — focused on measuring sign‑up rate and AOV lift.. Lighting: Polished editorial side light that sculpts faces and kiosk edges; confident highlights on tent cards, clean shadow separation.. Props: two kiosk tent cards (matte paper) labeled A/B, instant points metallic chip sample, discount price tag mockup, small stack of cohort report printouts (linen paper). polished editorial photography, clean gradients, confident highlights, single clear subject, generous negative space, modern materials, not a poster, not a collage, not an infographic, no charts, no UI, no labels",

    "prompt": "Scene: Checkout island vignette (low angle, tight crop) — register counter with tactile materials spread across a marble surface, customer's hand reaching for a wrapped gift sample.. Moment: Cashier swaps a planned percent markdown tag for a value‑exchange option — physically placing either a donation envelope, a gift‑with‑purchase sample, or a points chip into a display tray; the composition implies rotation/testing rather than a single fixed prop.. Persona: Cashier and loyalty manager mid‑shift; loyalty manager gestures toward the tray while cashier completes the handoff.. Mood: Measured, value‑conscious, experimental — exploring alternatives to blunt discounting.. Lighting: Polished, directional top light with confident highlights on the gift ribbon and metallic points chip; clean negative space behind the counter.. Props: donation envelope (kraft), small wrapped GWP sample (fabric ribbon), instant loyalty points chip (brushed metal), margin impact printout folded on counter. polished editorial photography, clean gradients, confident highlights, single clear subject, generous negative space, modern materials, not a poster, not a collage, not an infographic, no charts, no UI, no labels",
