  "executive_summary": "You must decide whether one additional dollar goes to loyalty, retail media, or collab-driven reach to lift early-window foot traffic and lower event CPA in the Nov 18 – Dec 02, 2025 holiday window without deepening blanket discounts. This matters because the plan must deliver **10–15%** base foot-traffic uplift (stretch **≥25%**), move current early-window share from **12–15%** toward **20–30%**, and keep event CPA at or below **≤0.80×** baseline to justify spend [^7][^4]. Favor a collab-led holiday paired with a targeted loyalty microcredit: use the $1 to activate top-decile members while running a collab SKU with in-store capture so trial converts to repeat [^7][^4]. In the next 30 days, cross-functional teams must launch a two-week pilot (Nov 18–Dec 02), instrument daily incremental visits, incremental spend per visit, and contribution margin by treatment, and use foot-traffic uplift, early-window share, and event CPA as pass/fail metrics [^5].",
