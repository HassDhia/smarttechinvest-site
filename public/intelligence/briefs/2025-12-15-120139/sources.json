    "content": "US job openings increase modestly in October - The Business Times Search US job openings increase modestly in October Labour market stagnation has been blamed on reduced labour supply amid a reduction in immigration Summarise Share Job openings, a measure of labour demand, were up 12,000 to 7.670 million by the last day of October. PHOTO: BLOOMBERG Published Tue, Dec 9, 2025 · 11:34 PM [WASHINGTON] US job openings increased marginally in October, but hiring remained subdued as employers navigated an uncertain economic environment. Job openings, a measure of labour demand, were up 12,000 to 7.670 million by the last day of October, the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said in its Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or Jolts report, on Tuesday (Dec 9). Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 7.150 million unfilled jobs. Hiring dropped by 218,000 to 5.149 million in October. The report incorporated data for September, whose release was cancelled because of the 43-day federal government shutdown. The BLS said it had “temporarily suspended use of the monthly alignment methodology for October preliminary estimates,” adding that “use of this methodology will resume with the publication of October final estimates.” There were 7.658 million job openings in September. Hiring was at 5.367 million in September. The combined reports suggested the labour market remained in what economists and policymakers call a “no-hire, no-fire” state. Labour market stagnation has been blamed on reduced labour supply amid a reduction in immigration that started during the final year of former President Joe Biden’s term and accelerated under President Donald Trump’s second administration. SEE ALSO Small US businesses more optimistic on sales outlook US weekly jobless claims drop to lowest level in more than three years US manufacturing production flat in September Payrolls at US companies fall by most since 2023 US economic activity little changed ahead of next Fed meeting, report shows More The adoption of artificial intelligence for some job roles is also reducing labour demand, especially for entry-level positions. Financial markets expect the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark overnight interest rate by another 25 basis points to the 3.50-to-3.75 per cent range on Wednesday out of concern for the labour market. The US central bank has lowered rates twice this year. Policymakers will not have in hand November’s employment report, whose release was also delayed by the shutdown. The report, now due next Tuesday, will include October’s nonfarm payrolls data. October’s employment report was cancelled. The unemployment rate for October will not be available, as the shutdown prevented the collection of data for the household survey from which the jobless rate is calculated.

Both companies know that customers don’t just compare prices — they compare how quickly a package arrives at their door. And as the video reveals, Walmart is now reshaping its fulfillment network with automation, software, and AI to close the speed gap and, in some markets, surpass Amazon entirely. The New Race: Minutes, Not Days Consumers have been conditioned by Amazon Prime to expect fast delivery. Now both Walmart and Amazon are pushing toward same-day and, increasingly, minute-level delivery windows. Amazon is testing 30-minute grocery delivery and building proximity-based micro-fulfillment sites near dense populations. Walmart is rolling out systems that give customers up-to-the-minute delivery updates and is actively piloting models that compress order-to-delivery cycles across their network. Both retailers understand the same truth: once customers experience dependable ultra-fast delivery, slow fulfillment becomes a deal-breaker. Automation Is the Core Weapon Speed is no longer achievable with labor alone. Walmart and Amazon are using automation to shrink physical handling time and eliminate manual bottlenecks. A Five-Step, Mostly Automated Fulfillment Workflow The video highlights one of Walmart’s next-generation fulfillment centers, where a traditional 12-step process has been streamlined into just five steps. Nearly all movement inside the building is automated. Key moments from the video include: 1. Automated Unloading Workers unload inbound freight, and from that point, conveyor systems take over. Boxes move automatically to the next stage with minimal human intervention. 2. Robotic Item Induction Instead of manually sorting and placing products into totes, machines handle most of the movement. Employees simply remove items from containers and place them into totes — the system handles the rest. 3. Machine-Measured Packaging One of the biggest pain points in e-commerce ",

They ostensibly were there to celebrate honorees Tom Cruise , Dolly Parton , Wynn Thomas and Debbie Allen , but let’s be honest: Leonardo DiCaprio (Warners’ One Battle After Another ), Jennifer Lawrence (Mubi’s Die My Love ), Adam Sandler (Netflix’s Jay Kelly ) and Ariana Grande (Universal’s Wicked: For Good ) don’t show up to the ceremony every year. They — and literally hundreds of others with varying awards prospects — were on the red carpet and in the ballroom because they’re great places to see and be seen by Oscar voters. So, too, was the American Cinematheque Award ceremony on Nov. 20, where Michael B. Jordan , star of Warners’ Sinners , was honored, and those toasting him included Sinners writer/director Ryan Coogler and actors Miles Caton and Delroy Lindo ; Bradley Cooper , writer/director/star of Searchlight’s Is This Thing On? ; and Tessa Thompson , star/producer of Amazon/MGM’s Hedda . It was but one of numerous Sinners -related events in recent days. Among others, Coogler received the “key” to Warner Bros. at the Somerville restaurant in the Windsor Hills part of LA — which was transformed into the Juke Joint, the Southern blues hall in the movie — on Nov. 21, with the rest of his principal collaborators in attendance. And on Nov. 22, they all turned up at a brunch at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills. Warners’ other major horse in the race, One Battle After Another , may be the frontrunner according to most prognosticators, including yours truly, and indeed it got another nod of approval last week from the retiree demographic with a field-",
