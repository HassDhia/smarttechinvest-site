Favor a collab-led holiday approach that uses limited co-brand drops, exclusive promo codes, and locked fulfillment (reserve or same-day pickup); in the next 30 days brand, stores, and partnerships must stand up one surprise co-brand drop and its promo_code instrumentation and measure code_redeems per exposed_audience within 0\u201348h versus a planned-announcement control.
