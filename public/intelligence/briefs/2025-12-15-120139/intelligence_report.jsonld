  "abstract": "You need to convert more of the people who are ready to buy in the next **48 hours** without resorting to blanket discounts that destroy margin. Focus on raising foot-traffic uplift while holding blended margin and driving early-window share to the **25–35%** anchor; track tracked response rate = code redeems / exposed audience and response-to-purchase conversion to protect event CPA ceilings and repeat rates [^5][^3]. Favor a collab-led holiday approach that uses limited co-brand drops, exclusive promo codes, and locked fulfillment (reserve or same-day pickup); in the next 30 days brand, stores, and partnerships must stand up one surprise co-brand drop and its promo_code instrumentation and measure code_redeems per exposed_audience within 0–48h versus a planned-announcement control. Success is judged by immediate early-window share lift and maintaining blended margin and event CPA against baseline while tracking repeat rate over 60–90 days [^5].",
