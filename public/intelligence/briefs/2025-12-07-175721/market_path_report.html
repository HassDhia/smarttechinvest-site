<h1>Shift December bargain demand forward</h1>
<p><em>Pull more December bargain sales into Nov 24–Dec 08 without deeper permanent markdowns</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can push early-window buyer activity toward <strong>20-30%</strong> of December sales; ask: approve a six-week, 10-store co-branded pilot to test that outcome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stores are already getting a disproportionate share of holiday bargain visits in the first two weeks, with the early window today only capturing a small slice of December demand. Bargain hunters are frontloading visits, so permanent markdowns are likely to shift timing rather than grow overall spend while eroding margin. Visible, time-limited events and scarce co-branded SKUs tend to convert that front-loaded traffic with less price pressure. That pattern lets us chase share early without rewriting price architecture for the whole season.</p>
<p>If you are responsible for Retail, Partnerships, or Marketing, run a focused six-week push across 10 multi-market stores from Nov 24 to Dec 08: partner-funded limited SKUs, visible in-store pop-ups, and gated coupons timed to the window. Use the collab-led holiday approach because partners cover discount depth while stores create urgency and Marketing controls impressions and CPA daily. Keep the test simple: fixed dates, visible placement, and daily CPA and redemption reporting so we can stop quickly if the economics break. This is not a permanent change; it is a concentrated test to reallocate demand into an earlier window.</p>
<p>A modest move in timing can feel like a busier store run: a <strong>10-15%</strong> lift in visits over the window means fuller aisles, more impulse opportunity and a cleaner December staffing profile. Shifting early-window share toward <strong>20-30%</strong> reduces last-minute markdown pressure and preserves average price across the month. Partners carrying discounts reduces our margin hit while still capturing bargain spend we would otherwise lose to competitors. Put simply, the upside is operational leverage—more productive hours and less forced discounting later.</p>
<p>The first thing that breaks is economics: if event CPA drifts above the threshold we lose margin and must stop funding. Contamination across channels and inventory shortfalls will make the signal noisy; watch daily CPA, coupon redemption and QR redemption to spot that. Measurement bias from a changed customer mix can overstate lift; control by comparing pilot stores to matched baselines and watching buyer activity share versus promo intensity side by side.</p>
<p>I believe a tight, partner-funded holiday window will pull forward meaningful December demand without rewiring our pricing. Retail confirms store ops and QR/coupon mechanics, Partnerships secures SKUs and funding, Marketing runs impressions with daily CPA guardrails, and Finance signs off on the stop-loss rules. Approve the six-week, 10-store Early Window Bargain Burst pilot and budget to launch by Nov 1.</p>
<p>What matters in this window is Holiday bargain behavior is frontloaded globally this season; early capture prevents competitors from owning the best holiday customers., Partner-funded, visible events preserve our pricing power and margin versus broad, deeper markdowns that compress long-term value., and A tight early window concentrates media and operations, making test outcomes visible within one or two planning cycles for quick scaling or stop.</p>
<p>Metrics to watch: Increase early-window buyer activity share to <strong>20-30%</strong> during Nov 24–Dec 08 (six-week window).; Keep Event CPA at or below <strong>0.8x baseline</strong> during Nov 24–Dec 08; pause if it exceeds that level (daily monitoring).; Drive <strong>10-15%</strong> foot-traffic uplift in pilot stores over Nov 24–Dec 08 (stretch goal of 25%+).</p>
<p>If you&#39;re aligned, Approve the six-week, 10-store Early Window Bargain Burst pilot and budget to launch by Nov 1.</p>
