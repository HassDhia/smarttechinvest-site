  "about": "Why Consumer Bargain Hunting Is Reshaping December Demand Patterns",
  "abstract": "You need to capture a larger share of December demand from bargain hunters early in the season without blowing margin or traffic efficiency in the next two planning cycles. This matters because a targeted early window can deliver **10-15%** base foot-traffic uplift (stretch **\u00025%**), and raise early-window share from the current **12-15%** toward **20-30%** while keeping event CPA at or below ** ** and aiming for QR redemption floor ** ** of footfall, so test visible, co-branded limited SKUs and timed store events rather than deeper permanent markdowns to preserve pricing power [^9] [^4]. In the next 30 days, prioritize a collab-led holiday program with Partnerships owning partner SKUs, Retail owning store events, and Marketing owning timed coupons, and measure success by early-window share moving toward **20-30%**, foot-traffic uplift at or above **10-15%**, and event CPA at or below ** ** while tracking buyer activity share vs promo intensity side by side [^9].",
