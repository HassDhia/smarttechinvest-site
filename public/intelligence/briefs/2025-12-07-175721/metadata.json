    "Visible, time-limited offers front-load visits; easiest demand to steal before competitors match prices [^9].",
    "Deeper blanket discounts lift traffic but cut real margin and long run pricing power; prefer limited-circulation collabs to protect base price [^4].",
    "In-store events plus QR-timed coupons convert visits into measurable redemptions; aim for QR redemption floor of ** ** of footfall."
  ],
  "executive_summary": "You need to capture a larger share of December demand from bargain hunters early in the season without blowing margin or traffic efficiency in the next two planning cycles. This matters because a targeted early window can deliver **10-15%** base foot-traffic uplift (stretch **\u00025%**), and raise early-window share from the current **12-15%** toward **20-30%** while keeping event CPA at or below ** ** and aiming for QR redemption floor ** ** of footfall, so test visible, co-branded limited SKUs and timed store events rather than deeper permanent markdowns to preserve pricing power [^9] [^4]. In the next 30 days, prioritize a collab-led holiday program with Partnerships owning partner SKUs, Retail owning store events, and Marketing owning timed coupons, and measure success by early-window share moving toward **20-30%**, foot-traffic uplift at or above **10-15%**, and event CPA at or below ** ** while tracking buyer activity share vs promo intensity side by side [^9].",
  "top_operator_moves": [
    "Lock one co-branded limited SKU with a partner and commit inventory exclusively for **Nov 24 6 Dec 08** to create scarcity and margin-protecting urgency.",
    "Schedule and staff weekend in-store events with timed coupons and QR redemption tracking and set event CPA targets at or below ** ** of baseline.",
    "Instrument measurement: report early-window share, foot-traffic uplift, basket size, incremental margin, and buyer activity share vs promo intensity daily."
