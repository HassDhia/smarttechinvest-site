Recent analyses reveal actionable gaps: five years of ML research show drive‑by download detection, mixed Naive Bayes performance, and inability to detect post‑SQLi compromised databases remain under‑served, while a survey of 18 Canadian pediatric tertiary hospitals found only 13 (72.2%) maintain pediatric‑specific massive hemorrhage protocol (MHP) content, leaving 28% with absent or variable pediatric guidance. For operators: instrument richer telemetry, forensic logging, and labeled pipelines; deploy heterogeneous edge inference (NPUs/FPGA/GPU), CI/CD for model lifecycle, and defense‑in‑depth combining hybrid/state‑aware detectors with rule‑based forensics; standardize MHP activation workflows, inventory checks, and EHR integration to reduce clinical variability. For investors: prioritize cyber‑ML startups addressing drive‑by downloads, post‑SQLi detection, and robust Naive Bayes hybrids, pediatric MHP SaaS and benchmarking platforms, and edge‑accelerator exposure; expect M&A as incumbents acquire niche capabilities. For business development: pilot with the 18‑hospital cohort, partner with academic authors to co‑develop datasets, productize a pediatric MHP activation suite, and offer managed detection/MHP services with outcome‑based SLAs. Immediate actions: fund targeted R&D, build centralized ingestion and benchmarking APIs, run measured pilots, and commercialize hybrid detectors and standardized pediatric MHP repositories to capture unmet demand. Winning vendors will combine validated field performance, regulatory-aligned auditability, and turnkey integration to accelerate adoption and pricing power.
