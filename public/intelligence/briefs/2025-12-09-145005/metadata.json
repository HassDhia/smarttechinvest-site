  "executive_summary": "You need to capture high-intent holiday buyers in the Nov 25 \u2013 Dec 09 window without sacrificing December margin or resorting to blanket markdowns. This window matters because front-loaded shoppers convert at higher rates and let you drive **10\u201315%** foot-traffic uplift (stretch to **\u226525%**) while shifting early-window share from **12\u201315%** toward **20\u201330%**, and event CPA can run at or below **\u22640.80\u00d7** baseline when tied to timed partner activations [^9][^2]. Favor a collab-led holiday approach\u2014timed co-brand drops or in-store watch parties\u2014and have Partnerships and Stores finalize a partner, lock inventory and staffing, and instrument daily foot traffic, conversion, and QR-redemption tracking within 30 days so success is measured by foot-traffic uplift, event CPA \u22640.80\u00d7 baseline, and early-window share hitting **20\u201330%** [^3]. Stop broad sitewide discounts during this window and test limited offers and experiences instead to protect December margin.",

    "Lock one co-brand partner and book a timed drop or in-store watch event on a high-attendance date (e.g., Dec 7) within 7 days.",
    "Shift a tranche of planned December promo dollars to Nov 25 \u2013 Dec 09 and restrict offers to limited SKUs or timed experiences rather than sitewide cuts.",
    "Stand up daily dashboards for foot traffic, conversion, AOV, QR redemptions and event CPA against baseline and pause further December markdowns unless event CPA exceeds **0.80\u00d7** baseline."
