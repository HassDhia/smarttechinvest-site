  "abstract": "You need to capture high-intent holiday buyers in the Nov 25 – Dec 09 window without sacrificing December margin or resorting to blanket markdowns. This window matters because front-loaded shoppers convert at higher rates and let you drive **10–15%** foot-traffic uplift (stretch to **≥25%**) while shifting early-window share from **12–15%** toward **20–30%**, and event CPA can run at or below **≤0.80×** baseline when tied to timed partner activations [^9][^2]. Favor a collab-led holiday approach—timed co-brand drops or in-store watch parties—and have Partnerships and Stores finalize a partner, lock inventory and staffing, and instrument daily foot traffic, conversion, and QR-redemption tracking within 30 days so success is measured by foot-traffic uplift, event CPA ≤0.80× baseline, and early-window share hitting **20–30%** [^3]. Stop broad sitewide discounts during this window and test limited offers and experiences instead to protect December margin.",
