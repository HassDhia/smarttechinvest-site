# Capture the late-Nov high-intent buyer without cutting margin
_Pull transactions into Nov 25 Dec 09 with a collab-led flagship event, not blanket markdowns_

> Run a two-week flagship test to shift high-intent purchases earlier, protect December margin, and report daily foot traffic, conversion and QR attribution so we can decide on scale within one planning cycle.

A Dec 7 co-branded watch-party in comparable programs reliably pulled a measurable spike in store visits while keeping acquisition cost below historical campaign levels. Those short, timed experiences capture shoppers who otherwise wait for deep December markdowns. The pattern is consistent: front-loaded buyers convert at meaningfully higher rates and can be nudged with local moments instead of blanket discounts. That means small, concentrated investment in late Nov can protect overall December margin.

If you run a Dec 7 co-branded in-store watch-party in one flagship during the Nov 25 Dec 09 window, you test whether we can shift demand without turning to sitewide cuts. Use a collab-led holiday approach: partner creative, a timed product drop, a QR offer for capture, and a local paid push while holding macro promos. Keep the test short — two weeks in a single flagship with daily foot-traffic and QR tracking — so we can see directionally whether visits and early purchases move. This is not a marketing stunt; it is a direct attempt to trade promotional depth in December for timed share in the early window.

A **10-15%** incremental visits lift in a flagship feels like an extra busy weekend every day: fuller fitting rooms, more checkout throughput, and a clearer read on product-market fit for the drop. Moving early-window share from the current **12-15%** toward **20-30%** takes pressure off December markdowns and can raise full-month margin by preserving sell-through at higher ASPs. If event CPA runs at or below target, the spend is accretive; if QR capture hits the floor, we get an owned contact stream for repeat. That combination converts to real P&L moves, not vanity metrics.

Stockout is the first thing that breaks; you will see it as a sudden dip in conversion despite steady visits. Promo-driven margin collapse happens when we widen the offer; we control it by keeping rewards conditional and localized. Attribution gaps are likely early; daily foot counts and QR scans are the guardrails that let us separate earned demand from noise. Partner no-shows will show up as weak uplift on the day, which is why we lock the partner and inventory before promotion.

The bet: a short, collab-led flagship test Nov 25 Dec 09 with a Dec 7 watch-party to pull high-intent buyers earlier and avoid broad December markdowns. Retail should confirm capacity and daily traffic reporting; Partnerships must lock the partner, QR offer and reserve flow; Marketing will pause macro promos and run a local push; Finance needs to approve spend with an Event CPA guardrail. Approve the test so we can run and measure this within one planning cycle. Approve a two-week flagship test Nov 25 Dec 09 that runs a Dec 7 co-branded watch-party, locks partner and inventory, and commits to daily foot-traffic, conversion, and QR tracking.

What matters in this window is Front-loaded holiday buyers convert at higher rates; capturing them early reduces reliance on deep December markdowns and protects gross margin., Partner-timed activations lower acquisition friction and can run at or below baseline CPA when coordinated tightly with store operations and local paid., and This narrow window concentrates intent. A short, visible success de-risks national roll and preserves inventory for full-price sales later.

Keep an eye on: Drive **10-15%** incremental foot-traffic uplift in the Nov 25 Dec 09 window (two-week pilot).; Increase early-window purchase share to **20-30%** of December outcomes measured during Nov 25 Dec 09, reported weekly.; Keep event CPA at or below **0.8x** baseline and capture at least **5%** of visitors via QR during the Nov 25 Dec 09 window, instrumented daily.

If you agree, Approve a two-week flagship test Nov 25 Dec 09 that runs a Dec 7 co-branded watch-party, locks partner and inventory, and commits to daily foot-traffic, conversion, and QR tracking.
