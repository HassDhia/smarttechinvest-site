    "Replace blanket percent cuts with selective value transfer: exclusive SKUs and tiered bundles shift timing and mix without uniform margin loss.",
    "In-store activations reliably lift foot traffic; pair QR gating to measure redemption and convert walk-ins into tracked early-window buys.",
    "Store-as-studio content amplifies partner exclusives and concentrates buyer activity early, lowering event CPA when audience and offers align."
  ],
  "executive_summary": "You need to drive higher-value store and partner-led holiday activity without broad margin-eroding sitewide discounts inside the next six weeks. Focused co-branded early windows and store-as-studio content can move buyers forward and into higher-margin bundles while aiming for **foot-traffic uplift** of **10–15%** (stretch **≥25%**) and raising **early_window_share** from **12–15%** to **20–30%**, with event CPA kept ≤**0.8x** baseline and QR redemption ≥**5%** [^4][^2][^8]. In the next 30 days Brand Partnerships, Merch, Store Ops and Marketing must launch a coordinated A/B test that replaces a sitewide cut with tiered co-branded bundles, three weekend in-store activations, and a short store-as-studio micro-influencer series. Measure success by progress toward **20–30%** early-window share, **10–15%** base foot-traffic uplift, event CPA ≤**0.8x**, and QR redemption ≥**5%**, since the collab-led / store-as-studio approach preserves blended margin versus blanket discounts [^2][^4].",

    "Run a six-week A/B test: control = sitewide 20% off; variant = co-branded early-window with tiered bundles and exclusive SKUs; track early_window_share, blended margin, event_cpa, and QR_redemption.",
    "Schedule three weekend collab activations across representative stores to test foot-traffic uplift, QR-driven redemption, and local partner pull.",
    "Launch a four-episode store-as-studio micro-influencer series to push awareness into the early window and measure buyer activity share versus promo intensity."
