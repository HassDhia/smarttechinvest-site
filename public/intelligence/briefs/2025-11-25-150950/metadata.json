    "Test design: two-week early-access pop-up + A/B (Arm A legacy markdown vs Arm B bundle+GWP+loyalty) to compress demand and protect margin [^2][^4].",
    "Primary goals: **10–15%** footfall lift (stretch **≥25%**), **20–30%** early-window share, **≤0.80×** event CPA, **≥5%** QR redemption of footfall [^1][^3]."

  "executive_summary": "What is happening: Operators should run a two-week early-access window that pairs branded pop-ups and content-timed events with a controlled A/B: Arm A legacy markdown vs Arm B bundle+GWP+loyalty inside the same window [^2][^4]. Why it matters: The unified holiday target pack is **foot-traffic uplift 10–15%** (stretch **≥25%** in top markets), **early-window transaction share 20–30%** (vs ~12–15% baseline), **event CPA ≤0.80×** baseline, and **QR/scan redemption ≥5%** of footfall [^1][^3]. What operators should do in the next 30 days: merchandising, ops, CRM, real estate and analytics must align on inventory holds, creative for Arm B bundles/GWPs, door-count or proxy instrumentation, QR→POS linkage, and an A/B holdout plan; **run the A/B** and lock measurement before launch [^1][^3]. Measure dwell, conversion, margin and CPA in real time and set a pre-agreed roll/no-roll decision rule at day 10 of the window [^1].",
  "top_operator_moves": [
    "Immediate 0–30 days: Instrument door counts or proxies, link QR scans to POS, reserve 3 flagship slots, define Arm A vs Arm B SKUs and bundle/GWP mechanics, and preprogram A/B holdout flags in POS/CRM. The mechanism is simple. [^1][^3]",
    "Quarter-scale (1 quarter): Run the two-week tests in 3 markets with branded pop-ups, measure dwell, early-window share and CPA, iterate pricing via unified data feeds and tighten promotional depth outside windows. The signal underneath is agentic pricing flows. [^1][^6]",
    "Compounding (long-tail): Bake successful bundle/GWP mechanics into loyalty journeys, convert pop-up creative to permanent shop-in-shop templates, and negotiate event-daypart lease packages with property to scale rent-per-sqft uplift. The leverage point sits here. [^3][^2]"
