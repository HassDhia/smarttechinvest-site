What is happening: Operators should run a two-week early-access window that pairs branded pop-ups and content-timed events with a controlled A/B: Arm A legacy markdown vs Arm B bundle+GWP+loyalty inside the same window [^2][^4]. Why it matters: The unified holiday target pack is **foot-traffic uplift 10–15%** (stretch **≥25%** in top markets), **early-window transaction share 20–30%** (vs ~12–15% baseline), **event CPA ≤0.80×** baseline, and **QR/scan redemption ≥5%** of footfall [^1][^3]. What operators should do in the next 30 days: merchandising, ops, CRM, real estate and analytics must align on inventory holds, creative for Arm B bundles/GWPs, door-count or proxy instrumentation, QR→POS linkage, and an A/B holdout plan; **run the A/B** and lock measurement before launch [^1][^3]. Measure dwell, conversion, margin and CPA in real time and set a pre-agreed roll/no-roll decision rule at day 10 of the window [^1].
