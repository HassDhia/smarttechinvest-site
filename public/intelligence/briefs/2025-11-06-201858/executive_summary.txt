Recent literature synthesis identifies clear ML gaps—especially drive‑by download and post‑compromise SQLi detection—and emerging interdisciplinary threats from information/cognitive warfare, plus corrected multi‑agent results that raise reproducibility and robustness concerns. Implications: operators must migrate from signature pipelines to continuous, model‑centric stacks with browser and DB telemetry, streaming feature stores, CI/CD for models, provenance/audit tooling, and adversarial/red‑team testbeds to prevent drift, poisoning and consensus failures. Investors should prioritize firms that own validated datasets, demonstrate third‑party benchmarked efficacy, and enable scale via cloud model‑serving or edge inference hardware; opportunities include niche browser/DB specialists, verification/benchmark services, and inference accelerators. Business development should productize around three white spaces—behavioral drive‑by detection, forensic post‑SQLi monitoring, and cognitive‑warfare signal fusion—via SDKs, cloud integrations, SIEM partnerships and vertical pilots in finance, media and government. Recommended actions: (1) instrument browsers and databases for behavioral telemetry, (2) build streaming feature stores and model CI/CD with canary rollouts and provenance, (3) run red‑team/adversarial validation and publish third‑party benchmarks, and (4) prioritize partnerships with cloud, browser and DB vendors to scale data and distribution. These steps close detection gaps, de‑risk federated deployments, and create commercial differentiation. Collectively, these measures reduce supplier concentration risk, support compliance-driven procurement, and rapidly accelerate trustworthy, auditable ML deployments.
