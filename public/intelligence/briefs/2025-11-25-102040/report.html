        <section>
            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>Run a concentrated holiday early-access plus pop-up experiment to hit the unified holiday target pack: detectable foot-traffic uplift **10–15%** (stretch **≥25%** in top markets), early-window transaction share **20–30%** (vs ~12–15% baseline), event CPA ≤**0.80×** baseline, and QR/scan redemption **≥5%** of footfall. Momentum lock. Frame the test as an A/B inside the same two-week window: Arm A legacy markdown versus Arm B bundle+GWP+loyalty to isolate lift and CPA. Brand, operations, analytics, property and data teams must align on the event calendar, door-count instrumentation, QR→POS links and an A/B holdout to deploy **within 30 days** [^2][^1][^3].</p>

                    <h3>High-value windows: events make stores sticky</h3>
                    <p>Physical events create measurable concentration of value in short windows. Barnes &amp; Noble shop-in-shop pilots show ticketed activations can raise dwell and social amplification quickly, with operator targets like +20% dwell time and +50% social video shares achievable within 30 days [^2][^4]. The mechanism is simple: concentrated experiences turn passive visits into appointment-driven behavior that is trackable and repeatable.</p>
                    
                    <p class="small">Instrument: Run a 30-day branded shop-in-shop with four ticketed events; instrument baseline and target +20% dwell and +50% social video shares versus baseline within 30 days.</p>

                    <h3>Agentic merch and scheduling tightens inventory and markdown math</h3>
                    <p>Centralized, agentic systems align product availability to event-driven demand, reducing surprise stockouts and blunt markdowns [^1][^5]. The signal underneath is coordinated data: a unified product and customer dictionary feeds automated schedules so featured SKUs are on-shelf when events peak. That changes one thing about how operators should think: discounting becomes tactical and time-bound instead of blanket and permanent.</p>

                    <h3>Landlords convert square footage into episodic demand</h3>
                    <p>Property managers can reprice and re-leverage underused anchors by switching from long, inflexible leases to short, experience-first pilots [^3]. Weekly ticketed activations in a converted 5,000 sq ft space generate foot-traffic spikes and create a pipeline of short-term lease inquiries that capture value beyond base rent. The leverage point sits here: ownership of the calendar and audience lets landlords share in event revenue and capture upstream brand relationships.</p>
                    
                    <p class="small">Instrument: Convert one 5,000 sq ft anchor to an experience-first 45-day pilot with weekly ticketed activations; instrument incremental foot traffic and event-driven lease inquiries over eight weeks.</p>

                    <h3>Collectible drops change the discount calculus and lifetime value</h3>
                    <p>Timed drops and live activations convert scarcity into first-party registration and repeat visitation, which compresses the need for upfront discounts [^8]. The mechanism is simple: scarcity plus community creates prepaid demand and reusable customer signals for future sells. This is where the model breaks if you rely on one-off drops without a follow-up retention path.</p>

                        <strong>6-month</strong>:
                        Event pilots prove repeatable in urban anchors. Short, ticketed activations and collectible drops become measurable growth levers in city and suburban pilot stores, producing reliable day-of-week lifts in traffic and social amplification [^2][^4]. Coordinated agentic merchandising across a small cluster of stores reduces event stockouts and raises conversion for featured SKUs [^1][^5]. Landlords trial experience-first short leases for underused anchors after observing higher foot traffic and tenant inquiry rates during pilots [^3]..
                        Watch Dwell time lift; on-shelf availability for event SKUs; short-term lease inquiries per pilot..

                        <strong>12-month</strong>:
                        Operational convergence: scheduling, merchandising, and leasing standardize. Agentic merchandising and event-scheduling systems consolidate across larger store footprints, turning one-off pilots into repeatable programs that drive margin-friendly conversions [^1][^5]. Landlords adopt standardized experience-first lease templates and revenue-share structures to monetize calendar-driven foot traffic and reduce vacancy costs [^3]. The signal underneath is platform-level data: networks that predict demand for activations unlock improved yield management and long-tail partnerships between brand, retailer, and landlord [^1][^3]..
