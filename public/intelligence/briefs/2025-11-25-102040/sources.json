The business has evolved from maintaining buildings and collecting rent to curating experiences, building communities and creating environments where people want to stay longer and come back often. This is the new reality of retail that Evan Walke , Cushman & Wakefield's managing director and national retail lead for its Asset Services group, is seeing. Walke said this evolution is accelerating as mixed-use developments combine retail, multifamily, office and entertainment into a single, dynamic ecosystem. “At Cushman & Wakefield, we’re seeing firsthand how these changes are reshaping what clients expect from their property management teams and how our approach is adapting to meet that moment,” he said. From Managing Space to Managing Experience Traditional retail property management was largely transactional: Keep the lights on, collect the rent and manage maintenance. Today, retail is increasingly experiential. Shoppers expect activation and engagement, from pop-up markets and public art to digital touchpoints that extend beyond the walls of the property. “For property managers, that means shifting from operational oversight to experience orchestration,” Walke said. “Every decision, from how common areas are programmed to how tenants are supported on the marketing front, helps define the overall brand of the property.” That’s why Cushman & Wakefield created a dedicated Asset Services group. The goal is to bring specialized expertise to an asset class that requires a distinct operational mindset. “Retail is public-facing, fast-moving, and deeply dependent on the success of its tenants,” he said. “The work doesn’t end when a lease is signed – it begins. Helping tenants open faster, perform better and stay connected with customers is now a core part of the job.” The New Shape of Retail: Mixed-Use and Reimagined Malls Across the country, traditional malls and suburban shopping centers are being reinvented. Owners are transforming underperforming assets into vibrant mixed-use communities that bring shopping, dining, living and working together in one connected ",
