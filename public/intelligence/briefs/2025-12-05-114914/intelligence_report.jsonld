  "abstract": "You need to capture premium holiday buyers during Nov 21 – Dec 05 without collapsing margins by scrambling price cuts across the assortment. That means targeting a **10-15%** foot-traffic uplift (stretch **≥25%**), raising early-window share from **12-15%** toward **20-30%**, while holding event CPA at **≤0.80× baseline** and driving QR redemptions to **≥5%** of footfall. Favor a collab-led holiday and store-as-studio activations over blanket markdowns because trust cues and partner validation lift conversion and repeat without eroding price integrity [^7][^8]. In the next 30 days Partnerships and Store Ops must run a narrow collab pop-up pilot with trust overlays.",
