# Win early premium buyers without cutting price
_Capture Nov 21  Dec 05 premium demand with partner-led store events, not blanket markdowns_

> We can lift early premium share while protecting margin with a focused in-store partner program; approve a two-week pilot and spend cap to prove the model.

One clear signal: shoppers respond when provenance and guarantees are visible at point of decision. That pattern shows up in passive signals and the activation research—higher-income buyers prefer selective quality plays over blanket discounts. The practical result is we can move share without triggering wide price erosion, but only if the event feels curated and trustworthy. This matters because the holiday early window determines who buys premium and who waits for markdowns.

If you are running stores, run a narrow **collab-led pop-up** in a small set of flagship sites for the two-week window. The test is simple: four event stores versus four matched controls and partner-led programming plus trust overlays on premium SKUs between Nov 21  Dec 05, 2025. Keep paid support and segmented email tight so acquisition cost does not balloon while the event draws the right footfall. Watch buyer share vs promo and stop any lift that arrives only from deep discounts.

This is not a marginal optimization. Hitting the target would feel like busier registers for premium items and fuller AOVs in stores where we run the program. A **10-15%** uplift in visits at event stores looks like more walking customers who convert at near-full price, and shifting early-window buyers from **12-15%** today toward **20-30%** means fewer customers waiting for markdowns. The top-line effect is concentrated revenue earlier in the season with less long-term price damage.

The fastest failure mode is trust overlays that look decorative and do not move conversion; we will see this as traffic without premium buyer share lift. The other risk is marketing spend that drives visits but blows the CPA guardrail; finance must cap paid activation to prevent that. Fulfillment pressure is real if guarantees or fast returns scale; watch return velocity and staff load at event sites in real time.

The bet: run a two-week premium early-window pilot in 8 stores Nov 21  Dec 05 that leans on partner validation and SKU-level trust cues instead of across-the-board markdowns. I need Retail to configure the stores and enforce measurement, Partnerships to lock collaborators and timing, Marketing to run the trust-overlay and weekly reports, and Finance to set the CPA cap. Approve the two-week Premium Early Window pilot and the event spend cap so we can run Nov 21  Dec 05 as specified.

The window is urgent because Holiday timing compresses premium decisions: early buyers lock higher AOVs and set post-holiday pricing expectations at scale., Market behavior favors curated validation now: trust cues and partner endorsements convert premium shoppers more efficiently than blanket discounts., and A compact, measurable pilot limits margin risk while testing whether partner presence shifts buyer timing across the holiday window.

Keep an eye on: Deliver **10-15%** foot-traffic uplift in event stores versus matched controls over the two-week window (Nov 21  Dec 05, 2025).; Lift weekly premium buyer share from current **12-15%** toward **20-30%** during the same two-week holiday window.; Keep event CPA at or below **0.8x** baseline and ensure QR-driven redemptions reach at least **5%** of footfall within the two-week pilot.

If you agree, Approve the two-week Premium Early Window pilot and the event spend cap so we can run Nov 21  Dec 05 as specified.
