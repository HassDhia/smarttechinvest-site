Parade-weekend flagship activations are expected to produce a 15–25% foot-traffic uplift versus baseline on the event weekend (test target). Stepping headline promotions 2–3 weeks earlier and tracking weekly sell-through is projected to increase early-deal share by 10–15% versus last year; design A/B tests to detect that range and measure promo ROI. In the next 30 days merchandising, store operations and analytics must instrument weekly sell-through and conversion tracking, book the parade-weekend timed product window or short pop-up, and run the forward-shifted promo A/B so decisions at week six are evidence-based.
