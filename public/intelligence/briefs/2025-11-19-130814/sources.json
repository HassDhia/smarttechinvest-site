(Retail TouchPoints) The holiday season is replete with holly, garland, sales…and pop-ups, especially in high-traffic tourist destinations like New York City. This year, two takes on the holiday pop-up, from Amazon and Primark , present an interesting study of the model’s variability and utility. The two companies took markedly different approaches to their pop-up experiences, although neither activation supported on-site sales. Online-only Amazon highlighted its Holiday Shop offerings in a richly decorated, three -story, three -day pop-up adjacent to tourist hotspot Bryant Park., Primark has opened a small “Studio” space in the NYU-dominated NoHo neighborhood that will remain open through the holidays and beyond, aimed at building buzz for the Spring 2026 opening of its Herald Square flagship . Two very different companies (not least because one dominates U.S. ecommerce and the other has no ecommerce at all) with two very different goals, and yet they both turned to non-transactional pop-ups to achieve their aims. Here’s how these varying expressions of the pop-up model played out. Amazon Brings its Holiday Shop to Life The “home theater” room in Amazon’s Home for the Holidays pop-up. (Retail TouchPoints) Amazon’s first-ever “Home for the Holidays Social Content Studio” was staged from Nov 10-14 at GH on the Park , an event space that at one point in time, long ago, was a stately home overlooking Bryant Park. For the event, Amazon transformed the three stories of the space back into a home, albeit with a modern bent. Advertisement Fully decorated themed rooms included a kitchen and walk-in pantry, dining room, “boudoir” lounge area, playroom, theater, home office and gym. Each area was stuffed to the brim with products from Amazon’s Holiday Shop , with QR codes placed throughout to “shop” the products on display. Image: Retail TouchPoints However, the goal of the event wasn’t sales. Rather, it was a chance for Amazon to break out from the expansive yet restrictive walls of the internet. The pop-up goal was to bring Amazon’s online assortment to life for media and influencers, all busily preparing their holiday hot lists and seasonal shopping recommendations. The idea was to create an immersive experience (which it certainly was) that not only allowed for product trials but also created opportunities for content creation and “photo moments.” Amazon also took the opportunity to highlight its climate-friendly product offerings with a dedicated sustainability section that featured products from its Climate Pledge Friendly program and Amazon Resale , including a curated Climate Pledge Fashion Edit available on Amazon-owned Shopbop . Primark Builds Buzz for Herald Square Store Image: Retail TouchPoints Downtown, Primark hosted its own very different pop-up, the Primark Studio, at 55 Great Jones Street in NoHo. The locati",

So here’s a guide — and some sales — to help you get started on your gift shopping journey. For your gamers The Nintendo Switch 2 was the biggest and most anticipated console launch of 2025, and if history is any indication, it will be increasingly harder to find as Christmas approaches. But for the gamers in your life — both young and adult — this is the gift to get. Nintendo’s Black Friday deals for the console and games have been announced but the best bang for your buck may be the console bundles. The Switch 2 is still available as just the console only for $449 or bundled with Mario Kart World for $499 . A new $499 bundle is now available where the console is packaged with Pokémon Legends: Z-A. Games retail for about $70 a piece, so you do save a little with bundles. Need a new iPhone?

This week also saw the fifth anniversary of the very successful Apple silicon effort on the Mac, contrasted with the future of the iPhone Air seeming shakier than ever. On the software side, Apple made some more tweaks with the second beta of iOS 26.2 and released the Digital ID feature to allow users to add their U.S. passports to the Wallet app, so read on below for all the details! Top Stories Five Years of Apple Silicon: M1 to M5 Performance Comparison This week marked the fifth anniversary of the Apple silicon chip that replaced Intel chips in Apple's Mac lineup. The first Apple silicon chip, the M1, was unveiled on November 10, 2020, and it debuted in the MacBook Air, Mac mini, and 13-inch MacBook Pro. The ‌M1‌ chip was impressive when it launched, featuring the \"world's fastest CPU core\" and industry-leading performance per watt, and it's only improved since then. We've had five total generations of Apple silicon chips, with the M5 unveiled in the 14-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ just last month, so check out our look at how Apple's latest M-series chip compares to the first one . Apple Debuts iPhone Pocket, a Limited Edition iPod Sock-Style Accessory While Apple branched out into the crossbody strap accessory market with the iPhone 17 lineup, the company has now gone a step further with the release of the special-edition iPhone Pocket , a knitted accessory much like a stretchy pocket or sock that can hold an iPhone, AirPods, or other everyday items. Available in a number of vibrant color options, the iPhone Pocket comes in both short strap ($149.95) and long strap ($229.95) options, although it almost immediately sold out in the United States upon launch. The iPhone Pocket was created in a partnership between Apple and Japanese fashion house ISSEY MIYAKE, whose namesake founder was the designer of the iconic black turtleneck worn by Steve Jobs. iPhone Air Sales Are So Bad That Apple's Delaying the Next-Generation Version The thin and light iPhone Air has sold so poorly that Apple has decided to delay the launch of the next-generation ‌version that was scheduled to come out ",
