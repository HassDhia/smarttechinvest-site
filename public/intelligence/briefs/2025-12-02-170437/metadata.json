Targeted third-week exclusives and events can deliver **10-15%** foot-traffic uplift (stretch **≥25%**), move early-window share toward **20-30%**, keep event CPA at or below **≤0.80×** baseline, and secure QR redemptions of **≥5%** of footfall. Favor a collab-led holiday with store-as-studio pop-ups; in the next 30 days Head of Retail, Head of Brand Partnerships, and the CMO must lock two retailer-exclusive drops and book five pop-up media days, measuring QR redemption and event CPA to decide scale-up [^6][^2].",
