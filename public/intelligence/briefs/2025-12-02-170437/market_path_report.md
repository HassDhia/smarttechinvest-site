# Why the Third Week of December Is the New Black Friday

> You need to win share and profitable store visits late in the season without getting drawn into month-long blanket discounts that bleed margin. Promotions frontloaded into November compress bargain density across weeks, creating a high-leverage late window if you avoid margin erosion (Nov 19 – Dec 03, 2025 shows this frontloading). Hold inventory and marketing for late-season exclusives and in-store media days to capture profitable visits without matching November discounts. Treat this as a directional read.

**Executive take**  
You must stop reflexively matching month-long November discounts and instead reserve inventory and budget for late-season exclusives. The favored approach is a collab-led holiday using retailer-exclusive SKUs and store-as-studio pop-up media days.

Promotions frontloaded into November compress bargain density across weeks, creating a high-leverage late window if you avoid margin erosion (Nov 19 – Dec 03, 2025 shows this frontloading). The window we're instrumenting runs Nov 19 – Dec 03, 2025. I'm asking you to mandate: Head of Retail + Head of Brand Partnerships + CMO lock two exclusive drops and schedule five pop-up media days; analytics lead must instrument QR redemption and event CPA for go/no-go.

Success = Nov 19–Dec 03 test stores deliver ≥10% incremental footfall, early-window share moves toward 20–30%, event CPA ≤0.8× baseline and QR redemptions ≥5% of entries. Retailers historically concentrated deep discounts on the Friday after Thanksgiving and captured most seasonal volume in a tight window.

Concretely, I'd run a 2-week test in 5 flagship stores from Nov 19 – Dec 03, 2025 and in those doors we'd execute a two-week flagship pilot (Nov 19 Dec 03) that stages an in-store QR giveaway plus pop-up media days to shift high-value footfall into the late-season window while holding event CPA at or below 0.8× baseline and we keep the footprint tight by inviting people within 25 miles so everyone sees the same drop cadence. Mandate: Head of Retail + Head of Brand Partnerships + CMO lock two exclusive drops and schedule five pop-up media days; analytics lead must instrument QR redemption and event CPA for go/no-go.

By week three the readout should be boring. If Keep event CPA at or below 0.8× baseline; pause or reallocate media if observed >0.8 and Stop the play in a store if QR redemptions fall below 2 percent of footfall, you keep running; as soon as either breaks, you pause and revert. If those checks fail, you thank the partner and fall back to the old play. Keep it inside Nov 19 – Dec 03, 2025 and stay focused on US.

In practice this only works if a few teams move in step. Retail needs to run the Nov 19 Dec 03 flagship pilot in 5 stores, deliver the one-day QR giveaway and pop-up media days, and stop any store play where QR redemptions fall below 2%. Partnerships needs to lock retailer and brand partners for exclusives and in-store drops for the Nov 19 Dec 03 window and confirm inventory and POS collateral aligned to the QR offer. Finance needs to confirm margin and CPA guardrails for the pilot, approve spend up to the event CPA limit, and flag any store-level losses for immediate review. Performance Marketing needs to allocate event media and tagging to measure event CPA versus October baseline and reallocate or pause spend if event CPA exceeds 0.8.

Ignore this window and you default back to blanket discounts. November promo match destroys margin shows up when Retailers frontload and stretch November discounts, prompting reactive broad matching across assortment. Reserve inventory and marketing budget for the third week of December; stop any broad discount that fails to exceed the weekly margin-per-trip target; run week-by-week price experiments instead of blanket cuts.

If Crowds Without Conversion holds, Stop blanket November matching: assign a weekly margin-per-trip target and reserve inventory plus 20–30% of marketing budget for late-season exclusives becomes the disciplined move.

**Why this works**

- When Promo season frontloads and compresses November value, Retailers are opening Black Friday deals well before the official weekend and stretching discounts through November, so peak bargain density no longer lives in a single weekend [^4][^5][^7]. Second-order That frontloading spreads shopper demand across more weeks and reduces the leverage of matching deep November promos, which erodes margin without reliably growing true late-season buyer share [^2][^8]. Stop reflexively matching every early November discount. Map your promo depth by calendar week and stop any broad discount that does not beat your weekly margin-per-trip target. Reserve a share of inventory and marketing budget for the third week of December. Use exclusives and events there instead of lifting all SKUs.
- When Exclusives lift conversion and preserve margin, Retail winners in 2025 leaned on exclusive giveaways and retailer-only drops to pull customers into stores and convert them, not just spike traffic with shallow discounts [^6]. Second-order Exclusives create scarcity and a differentiated value proposition that raises conversion and average order value while protecting unit margin compared with undifferentiated price cuts [^6][^2]. Design 1–2 limited-run exclusives per format and test them in a small cluster of stores. Price them to protect margin. Promote each exclusive with dedicated creative and a redemption mechanism (QR or barcode) that ties the in-store visit back to a marketing channel. Measure conversion and AOV per exclusive versus matched discount control stores.
- When Discount depth versus collaboration tradeoffs, Deep, broad discounts reliably lift foot traffic but they also lower margin per visit and train customers to wait, which undercuts late-season profitability [^2][^8]. Second-order Collaborative plays such as retailer-exclusive SKUs or brand drops limit price erosion, concentrate demand, and deliver higher-margin conversions though they may produce lower absolute footfall unless paired with event amplification [^6][^1]. Decide your axis: if you must buy volume, use targeted discounts on commodity SKUs only. If you care about profitable visits, allocate budget to collaborations, exclusives, and events. Build retailer SLAs for exclusives and holdback inventory to avoid dilution. Run one A/B test of discount-heavy vs collaboration-led promotions in matched markets during the third week of December.
**Where it breaks**

- November promo match destroys margin shows up when Retailers frontload and stretch November discounts, prompting reactive broad matching across assortment.. Reserve inventory and marketing budget for the third week of December; stop any broad discount that fails to exceed the weekly margin-per-trip target; run week-by-week price experiments instead of blanket cuts.
- Exclusive SKU cannibalizes base sales shows up when Launching exclusives without matched controls or clear product differentiation.. Require an A/B test with matched control stores for every exclusive; tag exclusives in POS and stop rollouts where cannibalization rate >40% after two weeks.
- Pop-up events miss CPA and footfall targets shows up when Poor pre-registration, weak local promotion, or low QR redemption at events.. Condition event spend on pre-registration and a ≥5% QR redemption forecast; cancel or scale back events that miss preregistration thresholds one week prior.
_Mental Model_  
> Measure QR redemptions and event CPA alongside footfall to attribute buyers, with **QR ≥5%** and **CPA ≤0.80×** as gating metrics.
