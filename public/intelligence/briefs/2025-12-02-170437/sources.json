Peter began covering markets at Multex (Reuters) and has expanded his coverage to include investments, ethics, public policy, and the health and travel industries. Learn about our editorial policies Published November 26, 2025 Santa Claus often rings the opening bell for the New York Stock Exchange each Wednesday before Thanksgiving. Desiree Navarro / Getty Images Close Key Takeaways The stock market rises most Thanksgiving weeks, though trading is generally light. U.S. markets close on Thanksgiving Day and trade for only half a session on Black Friday. Analysts expect record-breaking consumer spending this year—over $1 trillion in total sales—which could help sustain that positive tone heading into December. If you're wondering whether to adjust your portfolio as much as your belt for the Thanksgiving holiday, here's what the data shows: Thanksgiving week tends to be a modest winner for stocks, but don't expect fireworks. Since 2000, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed about 56% of the time during Thanksgiving week—barely better than a coin flip—with the biggest gains coming on the lightest trading days: the Wednesday before and the Black Friday half-session after. The data has been much the same for the broader S&P 500 index , too, which has been positive about 60% of the time during the Tuesday-through-Friday period of Thanksgiving week since 1928. The surprise for most is how stocks gene",

However, some retailers won with exclusive giveaways that enticed customers into stores. Published Nov. 29, 2025 Dani James Reporter post share post print email license Shoppers line up outside of the Mall of America on Black Friday. A lack of merchandising newness may have dampened the interest and excitement from shoppers this year, according to analysts. Courtesy of Mall of America Listen to the article 8 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback . Black Friday — and the holiday shopping season in general — may be more important than ever for retailers in 2025. But the event has evolved dramatically in recent years. “The Black Friday that we have come to know and love has changed,” Circana’s Chief Retail Advisor Marshal Cohen told Retail Dive. Headed into the shopping event this year, consumers were dealing with hits to federally funded support programs and continued inflation as retailers faced dropping consumer sentiment , despite continued spending . “We've kind of put ourselves in an interesting position of making Black Friday very important, but not as engaged and not a frenzy and not as much of a purchase urgency that we've seen in years past,” Cohen added. While the term “Black Friday” sounds focused on a singular day, the shopping event has ultimately become more of a multiday event of savings. To that point, it may be too early to tell how much consumers shopped based on early numbers, CI&T Global Director of Retail Strategy and Insights Melissa Minkow said. “I think it’s too fluid and too confusing at this point to limit Black Friday to just one day given how frequently consumers are being offered deals,” Minkow told Retail Dive. A clearer picture will emerge as numbers come out from the full Thanksgiving week and Cyber Monday period. Broadly speaking, however, year over year comparisons may be hard to do at the end of 2025 as well, given that 2024 was an election period and such years have historically dampened retail sales. U.S. e-commerce sales hit $11.8 billion on Black Friday, marking a 9.1% year-over-year increase, per Adobe Analytics data. Meanwhile, Salesforce data found that online Black Friday U.S. sales grew 3% to $18 billion. Shopify’s offline sales data collected from its point of sale channel saw 26% growth year over year in the U.S. Top line sales growth online and in store rarely tells the full story, though. There are already insights to glean, with the biggest Black Friday loser emerging: the consumer. Here are the highs and lows from Black Friday so far. WINNERS Artificial intelligence usage AI traffic to U.S. retail websites grew 805% compared to 2024 on Black Friday, per Adobe’s data. AI tools were used the most for the video games, appliances, electronics, toys, personal care and baby product categories. Adobe also found that shoppers who landed on a U.S. retail site from an AI service were 38% more likely to convert to a sale, versus coming from a non-AI traffic source. Salesforce data found that traffic from third-party AI agent channels increased 300% in the first half of Black Friday compared to last year both globally and in the U.S. Additionally, $3 billion in U.S. online sales were driven",
