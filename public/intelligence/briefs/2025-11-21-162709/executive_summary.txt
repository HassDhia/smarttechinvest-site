A coordinated early-access and pop-up program targets a unified holiday pack: **10–15%** detectable foot-traffic uplift (stretch goal **≥25%** in top markets); **20–30%** early-window transaction share (vs **~12–15%** baseline); event CPA **≤0.80×** baseline; and QR/scan redemption **≥5%** of footfall. The core test frames an A/B inside the same two-week window — Arm A: legacy markdown; Arm B: bundle + GWP + loyalty incentive — to measure substitution, CPA, and immediate AOV shifts. Collaboration teams must, within **30 days**, finalize cohort definitions and holdouts, instrument door counts/QR→POS links, tag promotional liability for cashback/BNPL, and lock the weekly reporting cadence for conversion, AOV and CPA comparisons [^1][^3].
