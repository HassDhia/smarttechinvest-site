  "about": "Why Consumer Bargain Hunting Is Reshaping December Demand Patterns",
  "abstract": "You need to win more of the holiday buyer who is bargain hunting between Nov 24 and Dec 08 without collapsing margin across the season. This matters because bargain hunting is front-loading demand into that window, so target **10-15%** foot-traffic uplift (stretch **≥25%**), push early-window share from current 12–15% to **20-30%**, and hold event CPA at or below **0.80×** baseline while driving QR redemption **≥5%** of footfall [^8][^9]. Favor a collab-led holiday approach: marketing, partnerships and store ops must launch limited-quantity brand×brand bundles and in-store activations in that window, instrument early-window share and buyer activity vs promo intensity, and measure against the stated targets within 30 days.",
