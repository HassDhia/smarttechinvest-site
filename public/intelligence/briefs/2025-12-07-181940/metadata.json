    "Late-Nov to early-Dec is a distinct, higher-value demand window; move high-visibility, limited offers into this period rather than spreading discounts.",
    "Deeper blanket discounts lift traffic but erode margin faster than they recover it; pair discounted entry SKUs with full-price add-ons to convert visits to profitable buys.",
    "Store activations plus QR-linked microoffers convert footfall into measurable buyer actions; aim for QR redemption of **≥5%** of footfall to prove in-store engagement."
  ],
  "executive_summary": "You need to win more of the holiday buyer who is bargain hunting between Nov 24 and Dec 08 without collapsing margin across the season. This matters because bargain hunting is front-loading demand into that window, so target **10-15%** foot-traffic uplift (stretch **≥25%**), push early-window share from current 12–15% to **20-30%**, and hold event CPA at or below **0.80×** baseline while driving QR redemption **≥5%** of footfall [^8][^9]. Favor a collab-led holiday approach: marketing, partnerships and store ops must launch limited-quantity brand×brand bundles and in-store activations in that window, instrument early-window share and buyer activity vs promo intensity, and measure against the stated targets within 30 days.",
  "top_operator_moves": [
    "Launch a limited-quantity brand×brand bundle program running only Nov 24–Dec 08 that pairs a discounted entry SKU with a full-price add-on, cap inventory, and report early-window share and buyer activity vs promo intensity daily.",
    "Execute store-as-studio activations in top-performing locations with co-brand pop-ups, live demos, and QR-linked offers targeting QR redemption **≥5%** of footfall; track event CPA and AOV by store.",
    "Lock sitewide markdowns to clearance-only, set category discount depth caps, and send margin plus event CPA reports to finance every week to prevent season-wide margin collapse."
