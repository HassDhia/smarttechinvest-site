# Capture the bargain-hunter spike in the early holiday window
_Win Nov 24–Dec 08 visits without collapsing season margin_

> Run a focused, two-week collab-led pilot to shift early-window share to **20-30%** while holding CPA at or below **0.80x**; I need approval to launch in 12 stores and online.

Our signals show early-window buyer share sitting at **12-15%** while promo depth ramps exactly in the Nov 24–Dec 08 window. That concentration is not a slow bleed; it front-loads bargain demand and squeezes full-price add-on sales later. Markets where partners run shallow, visible bundles are capturing visits without the deepest discounts. If we ignore this timing shift, we trade margin for transient traffic across the whole season.

If you are trying to protect margin, run a collab-led approach for two weeks: limited-quantity bursts of co-brand bundles with QR-gated reserved offers, visible in stores and on targeted channels. I recommend the collab-led holiday approach because it redirects discount pressure into high-visibility, limited inventory that encourages add-ons and partner-funded reach. We pilot for two weeks across 12 multi-market sites and online, track buyer activity vs promo intensity, and keep paid channels on a leash. Measurement focuses on early-window share, QR redemptions, and event CPA so we can dial promo depth daily.

A **10-15%** base uplift in foot traffic feels like steady new lines at the door and higher add-on attachment; in top stores stretch to **≥25%** where bundles pay for the display and staff time. Shifting early-window share to **20-30%** recaptures buyers who would otherwise force deeper discounts later. Hitting **5%** QR redemption converts reserved interest into measurable in-store conversions that justify partner economics. Put simply: more targeted visits, fewer margin-destroying clearance sales.

What breaks first is margin through discount depth and paid efficiency: if CPA drifts above **0.80x** baseline, the pilot becomes a loss-maker and we stop paid spend. Inventory distortion is the next failure mode; limited SKUs can create local out-of-stocks and disappointed customers if we do not enforce protections. We will watch CPA and QR redemptions daily; a rising CPA or flat redemption rate in the first 48 hours is a signal to throttle or stop.

The bet: capture front-loaded bargain demand in the two-week Nov 24–Dec 08 window using collab-led, limited-quantity bursts so we lift early-window share without collapsing margin. I need you to approve a two-week pilot across 12 stores and online, with Head of Retail reserving SKUs and protecting inventory, Partnerships locking bundle terms and QR gating, Marketing activating targeted placements and emails, and Finance enforcing the CPA and margin guardrails. Approve the two-week, 12-store pilot Nov 24–Dec 08 with CPA guardrail and daily reporting.

What matters in this window is Global and category signals show shoppers are compressing bargain search into late Nov–early Dec; if we do not act we surrender high-intent visits and force deeper season discounts., Partner-funded bundles let us buy visibility without increasing permanent discount depth, so brand partnerships convert promo pressure into margin-friendly reach now., and The two-week window concentrates measurable behavior, letting us learn buyer response and promo elasticity quickly and redeploy budget before peak season decisions lock in.

Keep an eye on: Increase early-window buyer share to **20-30%** during the two-week window Nov 24–Dec 08, 2025.; Lift foot traffic by **10-15%** (stretch to **≥25%** in top stores) across the same two-week Nov 24–Dec 08 window.; Keep Event CPA at or below **0.80x** baseline throughout the Nov 24–Dec 08 two-week window and pause paid activity if breached.

If you're aligned, Approve the two-week, 12-store pilot Nov 24–Dec 08 with CPA guardrail and daily QR and footfall reporting.
