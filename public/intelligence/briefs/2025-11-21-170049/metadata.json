  "executive_summary": "This two-week early-access and pop-up test compares Arm A (legacy markdown) vs Arm B (bundle + GWP + loyalty gating) to measure whether urgency and bundled value convert visits into durable enrollments and sales [^4][^3][^1]. Targets are **10–15%** detectable foot-traffic uplift (stretch ≥**25%** in top markets); early-window transaction share **20–30%** (vs ~12–15% baseline); event CPA ≤**0.80×** baseline; and QR/scan redemption ≥**5%** of footfall. To hit those numbers, teams must **within 30 days finalize cell definitions, instrument door counts and QR→POS links, lock creative and GWP logistics, and assign analytics owners with a control baseline and an 8‑week follow-up** [^4][^3][^1]. ### Quick scan",
