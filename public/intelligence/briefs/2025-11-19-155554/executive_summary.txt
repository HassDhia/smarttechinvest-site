Operators should run a two‑phase holiday activation: an early‑access loyalty window two weeks ahead of last year, followed by a public phase, and measure across an 8‑week trial to separate incremental demand from cannibalized sales [^4]. Design the test to detect a 10–15% weekly foot‑traffic lift versus baseline and track per‑visit AOV and cohorted repeat rate to validate net revenue [^4]. Target early‑deal share to exceed last year by 20–30% as a test objective; in the next 30 days merchandisers, loyalty, operations and property/partnership teams must lock early‑access SKUs and discounts, instrument footfall/AOV tagging, and confirm one 10–14‑day co‑branded pop‑up or civic flagship activation for measurement [^4][^3][^1].
