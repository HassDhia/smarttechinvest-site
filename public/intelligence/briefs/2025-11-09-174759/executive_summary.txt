The corrigendum tightens theoretical guarantees for consensus and cooperation in networked multi‑agent systems, reducing technical uncertainty and raising operational, investment, and commercial stakes. Operators must treat topology and numerical assumptions as operational primitives: instrument connectivity windows, spectral proxies, message timing and quantization; gate deployments with verification tests; and automate topology‑aware orchestration and staged rollouts to preserve provable convergence. Investors should reallocate capital toward vendors offering certified consensus stacks, edge compute and deterministic networking that preserve theoretical preconditions, favoring teams with academic partnerships and reproducible POCs while discounting firms reliant on uncorrected proofs. For business development, certifyable products and services are a commercial wedge: offer assumption‑verified SDKs, managed topology services, continuous compliance subscriptions, and audit/certification offerings; collaborate with standards bodies, chip and network partners, and academic authors to build credibility. Priority actions: (1) integrate spectral and topology telemetry into SLAs and CI/CD gating; (2) build hardware and firmware alignment plans to ensure numerical fidelity; (3) launch pilot certifications in high‑regret verticals; and (4) pursue academic partnerships and third‑party audits to accelerate adoption. Rapid operationalization of the corrected results generates pricing power, reduces deployment risk, and drives consolidation around provable, certified solutions. Immediate action secures differentiation, regulatory readiness, and long‑term resilience now.
