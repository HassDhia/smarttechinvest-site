ArXiv review of five years of cyber‑detection research finds systemic blindspots: simple classifiers (Naive Bayes) show unreliable 'mix performance' and surveyed ML methods effectively fail to detect post‑compromise SQL‑injection (near‑0% reliable). Concurrently, a Canadian pediatric survey (18/18 hospitals; 100% response) shows uneven adoption of pediatric massive hemorrhage protocols (13/18 have MHPs, 72.2%). Implications: operators must move to instrument‑first, provenance‑centric detection—deploy immutable telemetry, targeted red/blue exercises for compromised‑DB SQLi and drive‑by downloads, federated/incremental model updates, and human‑in‑the‑loop escalation to compensate for algorithmic false negatives. Investors should favor firms with validated, attack‑specific detection, rich labeled telemetry, and forensic/observability infrastructure; expect capital to flow to specialty startups, secure logging, and health‑ops SaaS that standardize MHPs. BD priorities: productize white spaces (post‑compromise SQLi detection, drive‑by download classifiers, Naive‑Bayes 'mix' audits), offer turnkey telemetry and federation bundles, and build a pediatric MHP registry/activation dashboard to serve the 27.8% of hospitals lacking pediatric MHPs. Recommended immediate actions: fund adversarial red‑team data collection, publish third‑party benchmarks, prioritize labeled dataset acquisition, and launch 8–12 week pilots tying instrumentation to measurable SLAs to capture market share. Measure outcomes by MTTR, false‑negative rate, and validated detection uplift; publicize results to accelerate enterprise adoption and M&A interest across customer pilots now.
