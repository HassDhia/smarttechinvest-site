One Piece is currently in the Elbaf arc and fans are getting to see some of the biggest reveals one after another here. From lore to some of the biggest battles of the past, the Loki flashback has shown it all to the fans. Through this incredible stretch of chapters that the fans have received as of late, Oda has also made it clear that he has bigger power-ups planned for the protagonist of the series, Monkey D. Luffy . Related One Piece's Gol D. Roger Has Been Dethroned By A New Pirate Roger is strong, but he can't solo this One Piece character. Posts 2 By Rei Penber Nov 6, 2025 As most fans are well aware, it's been quite a while since Luffy got his last power-up in the story. At the moment, Luffy's biggest and most recent power-up is Gear 5, and it is with the help of this incredible ability that he was able to finally topple Kaido, the King of Beasts. The final saga of One Piece has brought in newer enemies, however, and Gear 5 is no longer enough. It was apparent to the fans that Luffy needed new power-ups if he was to face off and win against characters like Imu, and Oda has finally addressed that by showing the fans exactly what power-up Luffy will gain next. Years after Gear 5, Oda had now officially lined up Luffy's upcoming new power . Luffy Will Gain Advanced Haki In The Final Saga Rocks Showed New Haki Abilities In God Valley Luffy Needs To Learn Haki Barrier And Haki Blasts Luffy's Haki Needs To Improve When it comes to Devil Fruit abilities, Luffy has already done the most he can. Devil Fruit Awakening is the pinnacle of a Devil Fruit's powers and Luffy expressed this himself in the Wano Country Arc. Upon awakening his Devil Fruit, Luffy clearly stated that he was now at his peak, and this naturally referred to his Devil Fruit powers. What is this feeling? I feel like I can do anything! This is my peak... This is Gear 5! — Luffy in One Piece chapter 1044 Luffy can't get more out of his Devil Fruit and that's clear, but he can still grow in terms of Haki, and Scopper Gaban clearly told Luffy that he needs to be mindful of how he uses his Haki. Luffy's next power-up is coming in the Haki department . Related After 15 Years, One Piece Finally Introduces A New Haki Power Haki is king, and Oda just revealed a brand new Haki ability in One Piece. Posts 13 By Rei Penber Nov 6, 2025 In One Piece chapter 1165, Oda showcased Rocks D. Xebec using a very unique power, and that's the ability to use high-level Conqueror's Haki as a barrier . Essentially, Rocks's Haki was so strong that it automatically nullified every attack launched at him. It almost acted like a barrier between him and the e",

Proceed with caution. Solo Leveling fans have received a ton of exciting content in the anime so far, and they're already craving more. In just about 25 episodes, Solo Leveling has created a very exciting cast of powerful Hunters and some other strong entities as well. That said, it doesn't come as a surprise to anyone to see that Solo Leveling is mostly focused on Sung Jinwoo's strength alone. At the moment, there aren't too many powerful characters in Solo Leveling , which might disappoint some fans. After all, without bigger obstacles in Jinwoo's path, it is difficult for fans to get excited about what's to come. Sung Jinwoo has dominated in Solo Leveling so far , and his biggest challenge so far was the Ant King , who fell easily to him as well. Related Solo Leveling Is Making A Comeback in November Solo Leveling is returning, and very soon. As early as November. Posts 3 By Rei Penber Nov 1, 2025 That said, things are about to get a lot harder for Sung Jinwoo in Solo Leveling as the new strongest will most likely be introduced very soon. So far in the story, fans have seen very little of the Monarchs, and even the concept isn't properly elaborated upon. In Solo Leveling Season 3 and beyond, this is going to change , and fans might even see a glimpse of the one who stands above them all, Antares . Fans of Solo Leveling will be ecstatic to meet this monster who will prove to be the ultimate enemy for Sung Jinwoo . Antares Is Stronger Than Sung Jinwoo Initially Antares' Debut is Coming In Solo Leveling Sung Jinwoo isn't that strong in the anime right now Antares is above his level Solo Leveling anime fans have yet to see the true strongest bunch in the series so far. Up until now, Solo Leveling has only focused on Sung Jinwoo and his development in terms of strength. Now, the series will take a drastic turn and focus more on character growth, and at the same time, bigger obstacles for Sung Jinwoo. Every time I get stronger, I feel like I lose a part of myself. — Sung Jinwoo, Solo Leveling The biggest of them all will be Antares, who could potentially be introduced in Solo Leveling Season 3 , depending on how many chapters it adapts. Chances are, Antares will appear in Solo Leveling Season 3 , at least for a bit. Related Solo Leveling Season 3 Could Kill The Anime Forever Solo Leveling season 3 has yet to even be confirmed. The long wait could kill the hype. Posts 5 By Rei Penber Oct 30, 2025 For those who don't know, Antares is officially the strongest Solo Leveling enemy that Sung Jinwoo faces in the original story.

Waits for a table in the charming bistro are common, especially on weekends, and the kitchen desperately needed more prep space. “We had the opportunity to take the next-door space over,” says Small. “We’ve always been in need of more space.” While Juneberry fans understandably might desire that newfound space be used for more seating, that arrangement isn’t feasible, Small explains. “We have a limitation to how many more tables we can handle because of our kitchen size,” she says.
