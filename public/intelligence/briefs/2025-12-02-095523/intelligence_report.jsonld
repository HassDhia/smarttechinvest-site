  "abstract": "You need to drive higher-margin holiday sales from nearby stores without surrendering margin to broad digital discounting in the next six weeks. This matters because focused local activations can deliver **10-15%** foot-traffic uplift (stretch **≥25%**) while shifting early-window share from 12-15% toward a **20-30%** goal and holding event CPA at **≤0.80×** baseline with QR redemption floors at ≥5% of footfall. Prioritize a store-as-studio / media-led holiday with creator co-launches as the primary approach, and have merchandising, store ops, and marketing run 2-week local premium offers, inventory holds, and QR-driven checkout funnels in the next 30 days; measure success by buyer activity share vs promo intensity and foot-traffic uplift. These moves follow observed local demand outperformance and creator-to-store conversion mechanics. [^6][^7]",
