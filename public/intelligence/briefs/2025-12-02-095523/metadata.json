    "Target top-performing neighborhood stores as isolated experiments rather than rolling sitewide promos; keep offers narrow: one premium SKU, one bundle, exclusive stock.",
    "Creators and live/store media move paid reach into owned demand that lands in physical locations and supports premium pricing.",
    "Replace broad discounts with short premium windows plus QR funnels to track redemption and buyer activity share vs promo intensity."
  ],
  "executive_summary": "You need to drive higher-margin holiday sales from nearby stores without surrendering margin to broad digital discounting in the next six weeks. This matters because focused local activations can deliver **10-15%** foot-traffic uplift (stretch **≥25%**) while shifting early-window share from 12-15% toward a **20-30%** goal and holding event CPA at **≤0.80×** baseline with QR redemption floors at ≥5% of footfall. Prioritize a store-as-studio / media-led holiday with creator co-launches as the primary approach, and have merchandising, store ops, and marketing run 2-week local premium offers, inventory holds, and QR-driven checkout funnels in the next 30 days; measure success by buyer activity share vs promo intensity and foot-traffic uplift. These moves follow observed local demand outperformance and creator-to-store conversion mechanics. [^6][^7]",
