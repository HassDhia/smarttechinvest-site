Recent ArXiv work introduces an interaction variable defined as instantaneous power (W) and a multi layer control architecture, demonstrated on an RLC circuit with one controllable voltage source, and shows reactive power commands can be implemented via Feedback Linearizing Control (FBLC) or Sliding Mode Control (SMC). A correction noting a serious mistake in classic consensus theory raises validation and verification imperatives. For operators: adopt a two layer model separating supervisory reactive power dispatch from deterministic inner loop FBLC or SMC control, upgrade telemetry to support instantaneous power signals, deploy deterministic networking and hardware in the loop testbeds, and pilot cautiously with certified modules. For investors: capital should prioritize control IP, power electronics with controllable voltage sources, edge deterministic compute, verification labs, and startups packaging FBLC and SMC toolchains; expect premium pricing for provable stability but longer sales and certification cycles. For business development: pursue middleware that normalizes reactive power APIs, licenseable FBLC and SMC kernels, and verification services; target microgrid pilots and partnership with OEMs and test vendors. Recommended actions: initiate small controlled pilots, require third party certification for control kernels, invest in hardware in the loop testing and deterministic networking, and formalize command semantics to accelerate safe scaling securely.
