Recent signals indicate a rapid pivot from research LLMs to production-grade, agentic AI and inference-optimized deployments. Energy, defence and mobility are leading: ADNOC’s multi‑partner agent pilots, an Australian startup’s AUKUS exemption enabling cross‑national defence sharing, and Waymo’s continued dominance in autonomous driving show industry focus on certified, revenue‑generating agents. Capital and editorial attention are reallocating toward inference infrastructure, edge compute, and verticalised startups as profitability becomes the gating metric. For operators: treat agents as operational cyber‑physical systems—invest in edge NPUs, hybrid cloud–edge orchestration, MLOps with staged rollouts, continuous behavior testing, and hardened security/compliance (data sovereignty, encrypted cross‑border links). For investors: overweight hyperscalers, inference infrastructure, and defence/industrial integrators; prioritise companies with contracted ARR, regulatory moats, and measurable cost‑per‑inference improvements. For BD teams: pursue cloud vendor integrations, defence prime teaming, short KPI‑driven pilots with outcome‑based pricing, and certification as a commercial moat. Immediate actions: shift capex from training rigs to inference appliances, operationalise robust model‑release and rollback procedures, secure certifications/licences, and structure pilots to convert to long‑term managed services. These moves capture automation upside while containing safety, supply‑chain and regulatory risks. Prioritise measurable KPIs, transparent reporting, and cross‑organizational governance to accelerate adoption while managing liability and systemic risk.
