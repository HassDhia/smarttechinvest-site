Front-load flagship campaigns into the pre‑Thanksgiving week (starting Nov 12) and measure weekly share‑of‑sales and traffic against last‑year baselines to capture shoppers moving earlier this season [^5][^4]. Design pop‑up and parade‑timed activation tests to detect 10–15% foot‑traffic uplift versus baseline over a 10–14 day window, and capture emails and 14‑day conversion to translate visits into sales signals [^3][^6]. In the next 30 days, operations, merchandising and analytics must lock phased inventory allocations, instrument store and site traffic and conversion, and stand up a 10–14 day pop‑up pilot so teams can track early‑deal share and target a 3–6 percentage‑point increase versus last year for quick reallocation decisions [^5][^4].
