    "prompt": "Capture Depict the choice to front-load a flagship campaign and inventory for the high-value pre-Thanksgiving window versus pacing spend later — shown as layered campaign markers converging toward a single storefront moment, implying compressed opportunity and margin tradeoffs.. Scene: Studio backlot staged as a flagship prep room: polished concrete floor, a long wood planning table, racks with branded fabric swatches, and a scaled storefront diorama; three-quarter low angle to imply presence.. Persona: Retail operations lead and studio creative director collaborating side-by-side (operator + studio), leaning over the plan.. Action: Pinning phased campaign markers on a scaled plan, arranging miniature inventory crates, and adjusting a window mockup while gesturing to measured printouts.. Urgency symbol: A set of graduated light bands and narrowing shadow slats across the diorama that visually tighten toward the storefront to suggest a shrinking high-value window (symbolic timing).. Key objects: phased campaign boards labeled S1–S4 (printed), miniature storefront models, inventory crates and tagged SKU bundles, fabric swatches and printed weekly baselines, measuring tape and a clipboard with printed charts (no digital screens). Lighting: Polished editorial lighting with confident highlights, soft directional rim light on faces, and clean negative space around the table.. Mood: Precise, collaborative, anticipatory — confident but focused on timing tradeoffs.. Props: phased campaign boards labeled S1–S4 (printed), miniature storefront models, inventory crates and tagged SKU bundles, fabric swatches and printed weekly baselines, measuring tape and a clipboard with printed charts (no digital screens). polished editorial photography, clean gradients, confident highlights, single clear subject, generous negative space, modern materials, not a poster, not a collage, not an infographic, no charts, no UI, no labels",
