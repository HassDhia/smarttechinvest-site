You need more full-price, experience-driven buyers from Nov 18 - Dec 02, 2025 without deepening holiday discounting. Treating stores as media studios can move footfall and buyer mix so you hit a **10-15%** base foot-traffic uplift (stretch **≥25%**) and shift early-window share from the current 12-15% toward **20-30%**, while holding event CPA at or below **≤0.80×** baseline and QR redemption at **≥5% of footfall** [^2][^8]. Favor a store-as-studio / media-led holiday approach: in the next 30 days align Stores, Marketing, Partnerships, and Analytics to price and sell short creator slots, deploy QR attribution, and instrument per-visit media revenue so you can compare incremental gross margin vs markdown cost. Measure success by the four unified metrics (foot-traffic uplift, early-window share, event CPA, QR redemption) and stop broad markdowns that exceed the markdown cost-per-buyer baseline [^2][^3].
