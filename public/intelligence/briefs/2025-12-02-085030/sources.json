In 2020, Swedish-born founder Carl Pei dared to launch a challenger smartphone out of London, 13 years after Apple’s iPhone first dropped. Consumer tech hardware is an industry that requires scale to succeed, and Pei could have built Nothing out of larger markets like the US or China. But he chose London for its design and brand-positioning potential, in a move that seems to be paying off. Nothing’s growth has accelerated in the last two years, with revenues increasing 150% to over $500 million in 2024. Pei says the company is on track to hit $1 billion in sales for 2025, and has collectively sold seven million of its headphones, earbuds and smartphones since launch. In September, Nothing was valued at $1.3 billion in a $200 million funding round led by early Facebook backer Tiger Global. Investors are backing its plans to double down on growth in the US in 2026 and invest in building “new form factors and software” involving AI, Pei tells me. Nothing's Phone 3a (top), Phone 3a Pro (bottom), and 3D printed moulds of design mock ups (right) Nothing’s audio products are its bestsellers in the US, France, Germany and Australia, where it’s reached a 2.5% market share. India is its biggest market for smartphones, where it’s gained a 2% market share. In the global scheme of things, this is minute. But, when we meet at the design studio in Nothing’s North London HQ, Pei explains how he is doubling down on growth to transform the business from an “if-you-know-you-know” European challenger brand to the the younger generations’ most-beloved tech power, globally. Pei is also keen to infiltrate culture. In the last year, the company has sponsored concept store openings, while its headphones are increasingly hooked around bagstraps at fashion parties. They also appeared on the runways of Marie Lueder and Jane Wade’s Spring/Summer 2026 fashion shows in London and New York, respectively. Vogue Business can exclusively reveal that he’s hired ex-Loewe CMO Charlie Smith to take those fashion plans even further. Smith will join Nothing’s executive team as chief brand officer in January next year, overseeing the company’s global brand, image, marketing, communications and store design. He spent seven years at the Spanish luxury house, and was instrumental in forming the tongue-in-cheek TikTok strategy that transformed the brand from a craft-led heritage label into a buzzy, Gen Z-favorite luxury house. Carl Pei and Charlie Smith look at model elements of Nothing’s products with workshop model maker Inigo Robbins “I think a lot of fashion brands and technology companies have been taking themselves a bit too seriously,” Smith says. “But I think through this idea of challenging the status quo, Nothing has ",

They’re buying into values, looking for brands that reflect who they are and what they care about. Whether it’s sustainability, social justice or community involvement, modern consumers increasingly want to feel good about where they spend their money. And they aren’t shy about walking away when companies don’t meet those expectations. This shift is rewriting the role of brick-and-mortar retail. To remain relevant in an age of online convenience, physical stores need to do more than offer inventory – they need to embody the brand itself. In-store experiences have become critical touch points for demonstrating what a company believes in. For many shoppers, they’re the most tangible, emotional connection to a brand. With the help of emerging tools like interactive displays and centralized content platforms, retailers now have more ways than ever to tell that story in a clear, compelling and immediate way. In-Store Technology as a Value Amplifier In-store technology has moved beyond promoting products – it’s now a powerful tool for helping customers connect with what a brand stands for. From digital signage and interactive kiosks to mobile integrations, today’s tech lets shoppers engage with stories that matter: stories about sustainability, local communities or social impact initiatives. Instead of pushing promotions, they offer customers a window into what they’re supporting when they choose your brand. Advertisement Imagine walking into a grocery store and seeing a screen highlighting food bank partnerships or the nearby farms that supply your produce. Or browsing in a clothing store and spotting a video from a nonprofit that your purchase helps fund. Some retailers go further, with QR codes and interactive displays that invite shoppers to take action, whether that’s learning more, donating or sharing a cause. The result is a more informative, values-driven store experience that empowers shoppers. Subtle tech plays a role, too. Mobile apps and NFC tags can deliver value-driven content at just the right moment, like showing a product’s carbon footprint or linking to an employee-led volunteer effort. These aren’t pitches. They’re proof. They show your brand’s beliefs in action, without interrupting the shopping experience. When thoughtfully deployed, they add credibility and texture to the in-store experience and make values feel less like a marketing tactic and more like a lived commitment. At its best, in-store technology becomes a quiet guide. It supports the customer’s desire to buy with intention and reminds them that their choices can reflect something bigger. Building the Infrastructure The good news? You don’t need to overhaul your store to build a values-driven experience. For most retailers, setting up the infrastructure – like screens,",
