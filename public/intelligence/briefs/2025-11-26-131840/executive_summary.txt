### Quick scan Holiday early-access pop-ups and event windows can deliver a **10–15%** detectable foot-traffic uplift with a stretch target of **≥25%** in top markets and shift early-window transactions to **20–30%** of sales versus a ~12–15% baseline [^2][^3]. When framed as a two-week A/B test—Arm A legacy markdown vs Arm B bundle+GWP+loyalty—operators can hit an Event CPA ≤ **0.80×** baseline and push QR/scan redemptions to **≥5%** of footfall, which preserves full-price sell-through and creates owned content assets [^5][^2]. Merch, ops, marketing, and partnerships must lock the two-week calendars, build A/B plans, instrument door counts and QR→POS links, and schedule creator-led evenings and ticketed events to validate uplift in the next **30 days** [^1][^3].
