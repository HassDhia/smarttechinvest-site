  "executive_summary": "### Quick scan Holiday early-access pop-ups and event windows can deliver a **10–15%** detectable foot-traffic uplift with a stretch target of **≥25%** in top markets and shift early-window transactions to **20–30%** of sales versus a ~12–15% baseline [^2][^3]. When framed as a two-week A/B test—Arm A legacy markdown vs Arm B bundle+GWP+loyalty—operators can hit an Event CPA ≤ **0.80×** baseline and push QR/scan redemptions to **≥5%** of footfall, which preserves full-price sell-through and creates owned content assets [^5][^2]. Merch, ops, marketing, and partnerships must lock the two-week calendars, build A/B plans, instrument door counts and QR→POS links, and schedule creator-led evenings and ticketed events to validate uplift in the next **30 days** [^1][^3].",
  "top_operator_moves": [
    "Immediate (0–30 days): Lock two-week test windows, implement door-count sensors or proxies, enable QR→POS tracking, and prepare Arm A and Arm B offers.",
    "Quarter-scale positioning (launch quarter): Run the two-week A/B in 2–3 markets, run ticketed launch evenings, measure early-window share and Event CPA versus baseline, and iterate SKU bundling.",
    "Compounding (long-tail): Convert high-reach pop-ups into 6-week residencies or recurring creator nights to convert content assets into sustained footfall and lower lifetime CPA."
