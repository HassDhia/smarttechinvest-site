Survey of 18 Canadian pediatric tertiary hospitals achieved 100% response; only 13 had pediatric-specific massive hemorrhage protocols (MHPs). Among these, 12 favored initial ratio-based transfusion transitioning to lab-guided thresholds; 10 used volume-based activation triggers and 8 dispatched RBC-only first containers, revealing protocol heterogeneity and kit variability. Implications: operators face operational complexity—noisy demand signals, forecasting strain, kit mismatch risk, and integration needs across EHR/LIS and cold-chain logistics; immediate actions include standardized activation schemas, event-driven automation (activation APIs, smart-kitting, robotic pick-and-pack), contingency stock, and phased pilots with KPIs (time-to-first-unit, wastage). Investors should prioritize platforms that deliver validated outcome improvements: pediatric MHP SaaS, supply-assurance logistics, and ML/cybersecurity vendors addressing under-detected attack classes; capital favors firms with measurable clinical benefits and strong integration moats. For business development, pursue pediatric-focused offerings, gap-analysis benchmarking to open doors, and bundled propositions: templated MHPs, activation repository + APIs, kit automation, prioritized transport, and dashboards tied to SLAs. Cross-cutting recommended actions: build national activation repositories and common data contracts (FHIR/HL7, RBAC), validate pilots at tertiary centers, instrument audit trails, and align product roadmaps to documented gaps to capture pricing power and reduce clinical risk. Near-term winners will combine validated clinical workflows, real-time analytics, and dependable logistics securely at scale.
