    "core_tension": "The exact moment an operator flips a time-boxed 'go' switch for an early-holiday campaign — urgency to lock a measured window vs. the calm craft of studio-driven merchandising for a controlled test (evokes S1, S2, S3).",
    "setting": "Backstage of a flagship store display: dark-mode retail lab with a wide expanse of negative space, a dusk storefront visible through glass, and studio scaffolding and rigging just out of focus.",
    "action": "Low-angle close-up of an operator's hand starting a brushed-steel stopwatch while a studio creative, slightly blurred in mid-adjustment, reaches for a curated gift box on a velvet-lined shelf.",

      "small leather-bound clipboard with colored dot labels (no text)"

    "alt": "Low-angle cinematic scene at dusk: an operator's hand starts a brushed-steel analogue stopwatch in the foreground while a studio creative adjusts a velvet-lined curated gift display in deep shadowed negative space; soft warm key light on objects, cool blue window light behind."

    "structure": "A radial, geometric map: multiple concentric rings (three to five) layered like ripples around a central 'YES window' aperture; rings are punctuated by small nodes and connecting radial lines forming a subtle network rather than literal UI controls.",

    "motion": "Visual flow of data implied by pulsing highlights that travel along radial lines from outer rings inward, accelerating and converging into the central 'YES window' as if a countdown has completed; subtle motion blur trails on the pulses to suggest time-boxed aggregation.",
    "palette": "Dark charcoal and midnight blue base, muted graphite and matte black materials, warm accent glow (muted gold / amber) for the 'YES window' and pulsing nodes; materials suggest brushed metal, frosted glass, and textured matte rubber for the tokens.",
    "alt": "Abstract radial signal map in a dark palette: concentric matte rings and etched radial lines converge as pulsing highlights into a warm, glowing central 'YES window'; colored metal tokens sit on outer rings indicating operator-set cohorts."
