The arXiv paper introduces a physics‑informed interaction variable combining instantaneous active power (W) and generalized reactive power (VAR) as a unified control interface and prescribes a hierarchical architecture where higher layers issue intermediate VAR commands and lower layers implement FBLC/SMC. Demonstrated on a single RLC testbed, the approach shows feasibility but remains early‑stage; a separate correction to canonical consensus theory raises concerns about unverified multi‑agent proofs. Implications for operators: adopt pilot deployments, add MIL/HIL validation, deterministic networking (TSN/PTP), telemetry for high‑bandwidth W/VAR, and formal verification of consensus modules and safety interlocks. For investors: prioritize software/IP and inverter OEMs that can deliver standards‑compliant VAR APIs, validated FBLC/SMC stacks, and HIL evidence; expect early VC and strategic M&A activity but note maturity and reproducibility risks. For business development: pursue VAR‑API middleware, certified firmware, HIL validation services, and utility pilots; partner with OEMs, standards bodies, and networking/security vendors. Recommended actions: fund controlled pilots, require audited proofs and HIL demonstrations in procurement, invest in deterministic edge platforms, and formalize VAR/W API standards to accelerate safe, interoperable deployment. Also prioritize cybersecurity and supply‑chain qualification, mandate field performance SLAs, and phase rollouts with rollback triggers tied to observability metrics and stability thresholds and vendor indemnities included.
