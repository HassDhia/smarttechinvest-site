The remnants of the Burberry that once occupied the space can still be seen, including dressing rooms and ample storage once home to clothes and merchandise. Now, that storage houses art supplies and drying work. Bisnow/Taylor Driscoll Artist Kris Shaffer's studio space at Zero Empty Spaces' Natick Mall location in Massachusetts. ZES co-founders Evan Snow and Andrew Martineau started the company in 2019, first leasing vacant retail space in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The Massachusetts studio was the Florida-based company’s first out-of-state location in 2022. Since then, the company has transformed 33 retail locations into studios totaling 150K SF in partnership with 22 real estate companies. Not all of the spaces leased have been in high-end shopping centers. ZES seeks to fill space where retail vacancies are high but affordable studio vacancies are low. \"We've been in everything from three-level retail malls, office buildings, pad sites, former Payless shoe stores, banks,\" Snow said. \"It doesn't have to be a vanilla box.\" In addition to Massachusetts, ZES operates in Florida and Virginia. On average, the spaces ZES leases stay filled from 24 to 36 months. Artists pay roughly $300 per month for shared studio space. The value proposition Snow and Martineau offer landlords is ZES art studios can fill and revitalize vacant retail space, driving foot traffic and attracting attention to potential tenants. Of the 33 locations Martineau and Snow opened, 25 have since been leased by permanent tenants. ZES began to operate during one of the bleakest times for retail space in U.S. history, the coronavirus pandemic. Roughly 12,200 stores closed in 2020, leaving behind 159M SF of vacant retail space, according to CoStar . For many landlords, filling up this empty space was a challenge as retail growth only ticked up 0.4% at the end of that year.

The business has evolved from maintaining buildings and collecting rent to curating experiences, building communities and creating environments where people want to stay longer and come back often. This is the new reality of retail that Evan Walke , Cushman & Wakefield's managing director and national retail lead for its Asset Services group, is seeing. Walke said this evolution is accelerating as mixed-use developments combine retail, multifamily, office and entertainment into a single, dynamic ecosystem. “At Cushman & Wakefield, we’re seeing firsthand how these changes are reshaping what clients expect from their property management teams and how our approach is adapting to meet that moment,” he said. From Managing Space to Managing Experience Traditional retail property management was largely transactional: Keep the lights on, collect the rent and manage maintenance. Today, retail is increasingly experiential. Shoppers expect activation and engagement, from pop-up markets and public art to digital touchpoints that extend beyond the walls of the property. “For property managers, that means shifting from operational oversight to experience orchestration,” Walke said. “Every decision, from how common areas are programmed to how tenants are supported on the marketing front, helps define the overall brand of the property.” That’s why Cushman & Wakefield created a dedicated Asset Services group. The goal is to bring specialized expertise to an asset class that requires a distinct operational mindset. “Retail is public-facing, fast-moving, and deeply dependent on the success of its tenants,” he said. “The work doesn’t end when a lease is signed – it begins. Helping tenants open faster, perform better and stay connected with customers is now a core part of the job.” The New Shape of Retail: Mixed-Use and Reimagined Malls Across the country, traditional malls and suburban shopping centers are being reinvented. Owners are transforming underperforming assets into vibrant mixed-use communities that bring shopping, dining, living and working together in one connected ",
