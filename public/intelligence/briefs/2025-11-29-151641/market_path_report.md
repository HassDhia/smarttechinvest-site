_Executive Take_  
Win holiday footfall and early buys by shifting budget from blanket discounts to collab-led activations and store-as-studio media. Target partner funding to protect net margin and hold event CPA at or below **≤0.80×** baseline. ->  tracks Footfall +10–15% vs comparable non-promo weekend in pilot stores -> Mandate: Head of Retail, Head of Partnerships, and CFO stand up the pilot and finance model within 30 days and commit to a week-three decision gate based on foot_traffic_uplift and event_cpa.

_Operator Moves_
| Immediate | Positioning | Compounding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Run a 6-week pilot in 12 stores replacing one weekend 20% sitewide discount with a co-branded in-store activation and track foot_traffic_uplift and buyer_activity_share versus the weekend baseline. | Replace one weekend 20% with a co-funded in-store activation: Signal S1: 6-week replacement pilot recommended; S3 finance guardrail targets event_CPA ≤0.8× baseline. | Partner drops shift early-window demand without deeper markdowns: Replacing one weekend 20% sitewide discount with co‑branded in-store activations in a 12-store, 6-week pilot will drive foot_traffic_uplift and concentrate purchases into the early window, raising early_window_share versus the baseline [^1]. Tracking buyer_activity_share and foot_traffic_uplift will show whether partner-funded activations preserve price while maintaining demand, and whether event_cpa holds at or below 0.80x the discount baseline [^1]. If the pilot fails to reach a predefined foot_traffic_uplift threshold (for example 10%) or event_cpa > 0.80x baseline by week 3, stop or rework the activation mechanics before scaling [^1]. |

_Decision Map_
| Approach | Best For | When To Choose | When Not To Choose | Key Metrics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Co-branded in-store activation replacing weekend discount | Head of Retail running regional holiday programs who can reallocate one weekend promo budget to partner-funded activation.; Strengths: Trades depth of markdown for partner marketing and exclusivity to protect margin (S1, S3). Designed to preserve price while driving foot traffic and buyer activity share through experiential pulls. | Choose when weekend sitewide discounts are compressing margin and a partner can contribute marketing or funding for a focused activation. | Do not choose for high-velocity stores where checkout throughput is the constraint or when no partner funding/marketing is available. | foot_traffic_uplift, buyer_activity_share, event_cpa, redemption_rate |
| Exclusive partner product drops to concentrate early-window demand | Head of Partnerships who can secure limited SKUs and partner marketing to shift demand into week one.; Strengths: Creates urgency and concentrates buys in the early window without across-the-board markdowns (S2). Effective at lifting early_window_share and earning partner media for minimal price movement. | Choose when you can reserve inventory for full-price channels and partners will promote an exclusive week-one drop. | Do not choose if you cannot reserve channel allocations or do not have real-time sell-through visibility. | early_window_share, sell_through_rate, post_drop_conversion, reserved_inventory_share, event_cpa |
| Store-as-studio / media-led holiday (convert promo $ into in-store media) | Head of Property or Head of Retail with flagship stores and physical space to run pop-ups or studio programming.; Strengths: Turns activation budget into owned media impressions and dwell that lift buyer activity share versus promo intensity (S4, S1). Provides a measurable paired metric between activity share and promo spend. | Choose when you can dedicate flagship space and want to test media ROI vs blanket discounts quickly. | Do not choose for stores with limited floor space or where checkout capacity is already maxed. | buyer_activity_share, paired_metric, dwell_time, event_cpa, media_impressions_per_visit |
_Buyer Guide_
| Option | Best For | Not For | Commercial Shape | Proof Needed | Where STI Fits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Traditional agency retainer | Brands needing turnkey creative, logistics and partner sourcing across many doors. | Small pilots or teams needing rapid, low-cost tests. | Monthly retainer plus production and media pass-throughs; typical minimum 3-month commitment. | Two pilot weekends with ≥10% foot_traffic_uplift and event_cpa ≤0.8× baseline or a clear step-change in early_window_share. | STI provides the test matrix, stop/go thresholds, KPI instrumentation and a one-page activation scorecard for the agency to execute. |
| In-house studio sprint | Operators with internal creative and ops teams who want control and fast iteration. | Teams lacking production bandwidth or rapid measurement capability. | Fixed 4–6 week sprint fee plus production budget; single short-window pilot per sprint. | One 6-week pilot meeting thresholds: foot_traffic_uplift ≥10% and event_cpa ≤0.8× baseline. | STI supplies test design, KPI dashboards, measurement templates and the stop/ramp rules to run the sprint internally. |
| Partner-funded pop-up collab | Stores with partner brands willing to co-fund activation and deliver marketing lift. | Markets without active partners or where inventory cannot be ring-fenced. | Cost-share model: partner covers a negotiated share of activation and media for a 1–2 weekend window; partner marketing contribution documented in the MOUs. | Clear attribution that partner-funded media drove incremental foot traffic and buyer activity, plus event_cpa ≤0.8× baseline in pilot stores. | STI runs attribution design, partner funding P&L model, and stop/go triggers to protect margin and cadence. |
| Performance-based co-funded promotion | CFOs who need capped CPA and want partner risk-sharing tied to performance. | Partners unwilling to agree payment on measurable outcomes. | Revenue-share or CPA guarantee: partner pays per buyer or covers incremental CPA up to agreed threshold for the event window. | A 3-week finance model test showing event_cpa ≤0.8× baseline under the co-funding terms. | STI builds the P&L comparison, runs the CPA guardrail, and instruments the reporting to enforce payment and stop rules. |
_Signals & Thesis_

_Measurement Spine_
**Anchors**
| Metric | Target | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Foot-traffic uplift target for partner-led activations | 10–15 % uplift vs comparable non-promo weekend | Head of Retail | base | Foot traffic vs blanket discounts |
| Early-window share baseline and goal | 12–15 % of total event transactions | Merch + Analytics | base | Transactions in early event window |
| Event CPA guardrail | 0–0.8 multiplier of baseline CPA | CFO | base | Event CPA vs baseline |

**Measurement Plan**
| Metric | Expression | Window |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Event CPA | Achieve CPA ≤ 0.80× baseline over Nov 22–29 for stores in the pilot compared to matched-control stores — Proves partner-funded activations preserve acquisition efficiency vs blanket discounts. | 2025-11-22 to 2025-11-29 |
| Buyer activity share vs promo intensity | Measure early-window share = 20–30% while promo SKU share remains ≈ LY or lower — Paired metrics show whether early-buyer growth is coming from converted new buyers or deeper markdowns. | 2025-11-22 to 2025-11-29 |
| Foot-traffic uplift (pilot vs control) | Footfall uplift 10–15% (stretch ≥25%) in pilot stores vs matched-control weekend — Direct test of whether co-branded activations drive incremental store visits compared with blanket discounts. | 2025-11-22 to 2025-11-29 |

_Mechanisms_
- **Tariff clarity lowers headline price-hike risk** — Fewer companies signaled price hikes as tariff uncertainty eased in Q3, reducing the need to pre-announce margin actions [^1]. (Second-order: This removes an external justification for across-the-board increases, meaning promotional pricing still drives short-term demand but now carries clearer margin tradeoffs rather than tariff-driven cost offsets.). Constraint: Run a 6-week operational pilot replacing one weekend 20% sitewide discount with a co-branded in-store activation in 12 pilot stores. Track foot_traffic_uplift, buyer_activity_share, net margin per transaction, and event_cpa. Commit to cut or scale after week 3 if foot_traffic_uplift is below 10% or event_cpa exceeds 0.80x baseline.
- **Exclusive drops concentrate early-window demand** — Exclusive, week-one product drops in high-traffic stores concentrate intent and move purchases into the early window, improving early_window_share versus a broad discounting cadence [^1]. (Second-order: The mechanism is scarcity-driven urgency plus earned partner media that frontloads visits and purchases, reducing reliance on deeper markdowns to clear stock.). Constraint: Execute a 4-week test with a week-one exclusive collab product drop in 15 high-traffic stores. Measure early_window_share, sell-through in week 1, conversion rate, and incremental footfall versus last-year baseline. Decision rule: scale if early_window_share reaches 20% within week 1 and event_cpa ≤0.80x baseline.
- **Co-funding shifts P&L and lowers effective CPA** — A three-week finance model comparing a 20% blanket discount to a co-funded 15% collaboration typically shows co-funding reduces net promo spend and can drive event_cpa below the 0.80x target when partners underwrite media or product costs [^1]. (Second-order: The second-order effect is higher owned-media value per dollar spent because partner funds can be reclassified as media or market-development rather than pure markdown, preserving gross margin relative to blanket discounts.). Constraint: Run a 3-week CFO-partnership profit model comparing net margin, event_cpa, and contribution per sale for (a) 20% sitewide discount and (b) co-funded 15% collab. Include sensitivity to partner funding share (0–100%), sell-through variance, and reclassified media value. Decision rule: prefer collab if event_cpa ≤0.80x and net margin loss is <50% of the blanket discount loss.
- **Store-as-studio converts promo spend into owned media** — Short-term store-as-studio pop-ups can reallocate promo budgets into content and live activation, increasing buyer_activity_share per promo dollar and improving paired metrics against promo intensity [^1]. (Second-order: The mechanism is twofold: localized experiential draw (footfall) and reusable content/media value that extends the activation's reach beyond the weekend.). Constraint: Pilot a 2-week store-as-studio pop-up in 8 flagship locations over a holiday weekend. Capture content, run local paid amplification, and measure paired_metric: buyer_activity_share versus promo_intensity, plus QR_redemption and foot_traffic_uplift. Stop if buyer_activity_share increases <5 percentage points or QR_redemption <5% of footfall.

_Risks & Exceptions_
- **Blanket discount margin erosion** — Using sitewide or storewide percent-off as primary lever to drive traffic when tariff rationale for price moves is gone. Detect Track incremental buyers vs baseline, net margin per transaction, event_cpa, and promo_revenue_share during discount windows; compare to matched non-discount holdouts. Mitigate Run a 6-week A/B pilot: replace one weekend 20% sitewide discount with a co-funded 15% collab activation in 12 pilot stores. Stop or revert if foot_traffic_uplift <10% or event_cpa >0.80x baseline after week 3.
- **Collab-driven stockouts cannibalize full-price sales** — Week-one exclusive collab drops with insufficient channel allocation or no reserved inventory for full-price channels. Detect Monitor early_window_share, sell-through rate, post-drop conversion, lost_sales_rate, and timing of repeat purchases; flag channels with >70% sell-through in first 72 hours. Mitigate Allocate controlled inventory windows and reserve a full-price SKU pool. Run a 4-week test: launch week-one exclusive drops in 15 high-traffic stores with 20% inventory reserve for full-price channels; measure early_window_share and post-drop conversion.
- **Store-as-studio traffic without buyer conversion** — Turning stores into content studios or non-transactional events without gating or direct-sale mechanics. Detect Track buyer_activity_share vs foot_traffic_uplift, average_order_value, dwell_time, staff_hours_per_event, and paired_metric (buyer_activity_share / promo_intensity). Mitigate Run a 2-week store-as-studio pilot in 8 flagships with gated direct-to-sale offers. Stop if buyer_activity_share uplift <10% or event_cpa >1.0x baseline.
- **Measurement contamination masks true lift** — Running concurrent tests across stores/channels without clear holdouts or pre-registered metrics. Detect Look for inconsistent uplift across comparable holdouts, high variance in treatment effects, divergence between modeled and observed P&L, and failed placebo tests. Mitigate Define strict control stores and time windows. Pre-register metrics and run isolated randomization. Have CFO and Head of Partnerships run a 3-week finance model comparing P&L of a 20% blanket discount vs a co-funded 15% collaboration targeting event_cpa ≤0.80x baseline.

_Mini Case Story_  
Then: Retailers historically ran blanket weekend sitewide discounts to drive holiday footfall and clear inventory.
Now: Brands are testing co-branded in-store activations that trade depth of discount for partner marketing and exclusivity to protect margin.
Operator move: Head of Retail run a 6-week pilot replacing one weekend 20% storewide discount with a co-branded in-store activation in 12 pilot stores and measure foot_traffic_uplift and buyer_activity_share versus control.

_Closing Frame_  
If Tariff Clarity Lowers Cost Shock is true, Run a 6-week pilot in 12 stores replacing one weekend 20% sitewide discount with a co-branded in-store activation and track foot_traffic_uplift and buyer_activity_share versus the weekend baseline. becomes optimal.

_One-Line Mental Model_  
> Store-as-studio pop-ups drive buyer activity share per promo dollar and raise QR redemption toward the **≥5%** floor when paired with in-store exclusives.
