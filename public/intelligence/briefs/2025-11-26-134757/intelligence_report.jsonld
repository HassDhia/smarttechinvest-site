  "abstract": "We will run a unified holiday target pack across early-access windows and pop-up labs to drive measurable store-side performance. Targets: foot-traffic uplift **10–15%** (stretch **≥25%** in top markets), early-window transaction share **20–30%** (vs ~12–15% baseline), event CPA ≤**0.80×** baseline, and QR/scan redemption ≥**5%** of footfall. The test frames Arm A as legacy markdown versus Arm B as bundle plus GWP plus loyalty inside the same two-week window to isolate attention versus price effects. Collaboration teams must lock inventory windows, instrument door counts and QR→POS links, configure the A/B holdout, and route analytics to daily ops reviews within **30 days**. [^1][^3][^7]",
