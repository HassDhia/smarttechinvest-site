    "AI recommendations reduce search friction and accelerate conversion velocity; test on a defined high-margin holiday SKU slice and freeze inventory rules to isolate effect.",
    "0% BNPL often preserves headline price and raises conversion but carries fees and return dynamics; run a matched-basket CPA and net-margin test against a 15% sitewide promo.",
    "Mobile QR plus capped cash-back treats stores as measurable media; target QR redemption \u22655% of footfall and track adjusted event CPA to validate store-as-studio economics."

  "executive_summary": "You need to capture more early holiday buyers and protect margin without defaulting to deeper headline discounts in the next two weeks. Lifting early-window share from the current 12-15% toward 20-30% while keeping event CPA at or below \u22640.80\u00d7 baseline and driving a 10-15% foot-traffic uplift reduces the need for sitewide markdowns and preserves net margin. Favor a store-as-studio / media-led holiday that combines AI-driven onsite and email personalization with mobile QR offers and capped cash-back partnerships to shift intent earlier. In the next 30 days merchandising, finance, and partnerships must run three pilots\u2014AI recommendations vs control, 0% BNPL vs 15% sitewide on matched baskets, and a capped cash-back QR pilot\u2014and measure early-window share, event CPA, QR redemption and net margin per order to decide scale [^2][^5][^1].",
