Do They Actually Work? By Sarah Schwartz — November 20, 2025 | Updated: November 25, 2025 7 min read iStock/Getty Share article Remove Save to favorites Save to favorites Print Email Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Copy URL It’s not uncommon now for young elementary school students to do a substantial chunk of their reading practice in class with virtual tutors. Artificial intelligence powers these digital programs, which listen to 5- and 6-year-olds read and offer feedback. Amira Learning, one of the most widely adopted offerings on the market, has statewide contracts in 10 states . Several big providers of early reading curricula and intervention materials—including McGraw Hill and Curriculum Associates—have integrated similar AI tools into their literacy programs, or created their own. AI tutors promise a solution to one of the thorniest challenges in early elementary reading instruction: providing students lots of opportunities for practice, with immediate feedback. As students are learning how to link spoken sounds to written letters, they need regular practice with the specific phonics patterns they’re learning. Teachers need to guide this process. In a class of two dozen students, where some may need extra help with previously learned skills and others are ready to move on, finding time for everyone to have one-on-one or small group instruction can be nearly impossible. But even as schools are adopting the new AI reading tools, research on their effect on reading outcomes among young students isn’t conclusive. Even asking how well AI reading tools work is a multifaceted question: Can they accurately parse children’s speech? Do they actually save teachers time? And do they lead to better student outcomes? Another question is comparative. Are the results with these tools better than what would have happened in their absence? Than other digital programs? Or than teacher-led independent practice? “There are a few studies, but none of the rigorous studies that we would need to be confident in the use of AI,” said Matt Burns, a professor of special education at the University of Florida. Burns is involved in a grant to the University of Florida Literacy Institute to study AI integration into its early reading curriculum . In part, that’s because the AI capabilities rea",

They promise friendship but disrupt children’s relationships and resilience, the group said.“What’s different about young children is that their brains are being wired for the first time and developmentally it is natural for them to be trustful, for them to seek relationships with kind and friendly characters,” said Rachel Franz, director of Fairplay’s Young Children Thrive Offline Program. Because of this, she added, the trust young children are placing in these toys can exacerbate the types of harms older children are already experiencing with AI chatbots.A separate report Thursday by Common Sense Media and psychiatrists at Stanford University’s medical school warned teenagers against using popular AI chatbots as therapists.Fairplay, a 25-year-old organization formerly known as the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, has been warning about AI toys for years. They just weren’t as advanced as they are today. A decade ago, during an emerging fad of internet-connected toys and AI speech recognition, the group helped lead a backlash against Mattel’s talking Hello Barbie doll, which it said was recording and analyzing children’s conversations.This time, though AI toys are mostly sold online and more popular in Asia than elsewhere, Franz said some have started to appear on store shelves in the U.S. and more could be on the way.“Everything has been released with no regulation and no research, so it gives us extra pause when all of a sudden we see more and more manufacturers, including Mattel, who recently partnered with OpenAI, potentially putting out these products,” Franz said.It’s the second big seasonal warning against AI toys since consumer advocates at U.S. PIRG last week called out the trend in its annual “Trouble in Toyland” report that typically looks at a range of product hazards, such as high-powered",
