You need to capture more early holiday buyers and protect margin without defaulting to deeper headline discounts in the next two weeks. Lifting early-window share from the current 12-15% toward 20-30% while keeping event CPA at or below ≤0.80× baseline and driving a 10-15% foot-traffic uplift reduces the need for sitewide markdowns and preserves net margin. Favor a store-as-studio / media-led holiday that combines AI-driven onsite and email personalization with mobile QR offers and capped cash-back partnerships to shift intent earlier. In the next 30 days merchandising, finance, and partnerships must run three pilots—AI recommendations vs control, 0% BNPL vs 15% sitewide on matched baskets, and a capped cash-back QR pilot—and measure early-window share, event CPA, QR redemption and net margin per order to decide scale [^2][^5][^1].
