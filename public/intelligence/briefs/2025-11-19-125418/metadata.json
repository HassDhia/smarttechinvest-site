Set a test target to increase early-deal share by 5–10 percentage points versus last year, and in the next 30 days merchandising, store operations, local events, and analytics must lock assortments, allocate inventory, confirm pop-up sites and permits, define loyalty access rules, and instrument cohort A/B measurement for daily reporting [^3][^1].",
