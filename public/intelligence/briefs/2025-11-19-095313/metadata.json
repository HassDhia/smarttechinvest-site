    "Two‑week pre‑Parade window offers the clearest opportunity to capture incremental traffic with measured spend versus baseline.",
    "Parade hour creates a concentrated demand spike that should be instrumented at hour level to distinguish true lift from timing shifts.",
    "Targeted, loyalty‑segmented offers and A/B discount tests will help protect margin in a slower holiday growth environment."
  ],
  "executive_summary": "Shifting promotional effort into a two‑week 'pre‑Parade' campaign and a parade‑hour activation drove an estimated 12–18% foot‑traffic uplift versus baseline week averages in comparable markets [^1][^5]. Early deals now appear to capture about 20–25% more share of buyer activity than last year as holiday shopping moves earlier [^3][^4]. Over the next 30 days merchandising, store operations and analytics must stand up the pre‑Parade calendar, enable hourly footfall/AOV tracking, launch the timed in‑store parade activation and a co‑branded pop‑up pilot, and run a controlled A/B discount test so we can measure incremental lift against last year and a held baseline [^2][^4][^8].",
  "top_operator_moves": [
    "Launch the two‑week pre‑Parade campaign now; enable hourly footfall, AOV and conversion tracking and baseline against last year.",
    "Deploy a timed in‑store parade‑hour activation and measure incremental footfall and conversion versus adjacent hours.",
    "Pilot a co‑branded pop‑up in a high‑traffic flagship to capture email/CRO and run a controlled A/B test of broad vs targeted promotions."
