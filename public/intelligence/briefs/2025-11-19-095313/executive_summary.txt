Shifting promotional effort into a two‑week 'pre‑Parade' campaign and a parade‑hour activation drove an estimated 12–18% foot‑traffic uplift versus baseline week averages in comparable markets [^1][^5]. Early deals now appear to capture about 20–25% more share of buyer activity than last year as holiday shopping moves earlier [^3][^4]. Over the next 30 days merchandising, store operations and analytics must stand up the pre‑Parade calendar, enable hourly footfall/AOV tracking, launch the timed in‑store parade activation and a co‑branded pop‑up pilot, and run a controlled A/B discount test so we can measure incremental lift against last year and a held baseline [^2][^4][^8].
