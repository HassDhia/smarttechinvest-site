  "hero": "Cinematic dark scene: a moody studio corner shot with deep negativespace where an operator and a studio creative hunch over a brushed‑steel stopwatch/countdown device and a folded promotional calendar marked for a two‑week 'pre‑Parade' time box, no text. Low three‑quarter angle, subjects lit by a single tungsten rim light and a cold LED backfill; materials include matte paper storyboards, linen swatches, leather gloves and a glass jar of pins to signal tactile operational planning. The collaborators adjust the mechanical dial while scattered token markers for S1–S5 (market, cultural, behavioral, market‑discount, technology) sit like artifacts on a dark oak table, implying measurement of footfall, AOV and conversion without any UI or lettering.",
  "hero_alt": "Dark studio vignette showing two people leaning over a brushed‑steel mechanical stopwatch and folded calendar on a dark oak table; rim light outlines their hands, storyboards and a glass jar of pins, conveying a countdown for a two‑week pre‑Parade campaign and operational planning without any text.",
  "signal_map": "Top‑down abstract data vignette: five matte concentric rings (each ring represented by a frosted glass band) tighten toward a small illuminated 'YES window' aperture at center, with subtle colored pin‑lights that correspond to S1–S5. The composition is centered, negative space around the circular map, camera straight above, materials are frosted glass and brushed metal, moody low lighting creates a cinematic halo around the converging rings to signal prioritized conversion.",
  "signal_map_alt": "Top‑down image of five frosted glass concentric rings converging on a small illuminated rectangular 'YES window' at the center; colored pin‑lights mark each ring to represent five signals and the scene is lit in low, moody tones.",

    "Exterior dusk hero: three‑quarter view of a flagship retail window at dusk, rain‑slick pavement reflecting warm window light; an operator positions a pop‑up inset kiosk visible through the glass while a family bundle of boxed products sits on the internal counter, all framed with wide negative space and a subtle stop‑watch strap hanging nearby to imply a timed parade‑hour activation (S1, S2, S3). Composition cues — low angle, long lens compression, materials: brass window frame, glass reflections, matte cardboard packaging; cinematic, no text, emphasis on collaboration between store operator and creative studio.",
    "Interior dusk counter study: low angled close shot of the retail counter with a family bundle arranged on varnished wood, a small matte black MVP device (AI recommendation engine) being installed by a studio tech and operator, and two stacks of test cards suggesting an A/B discount experiment; pop‑up inset sits in soft focus through the window behind them. Composition cues — shallow depth of field, side light from the window, materials: matte plastic device, wooden counter, linen receipt pad; moody, dark‑mode lighting to convey measurement of discounting math and tech‑driven personalization (S4, S5)."
