The minimal frame evokes the two‑week pre‑Parade campaign and parade‑hour activation—co‑branded pop‑up pilot, hourly footfall/AOV tracking and A/B discount test—hinting at the estimated 12–18% foot‑traffic uplift and 20–25% earlier buyer share.. dark-mode editorial photography, charcoal + cyan palette, dramatic edge lighting, single subject, generous negative space, cinematic contrast, not a poster, not a collage, not an infographic, no charts, no UI, no labels",
