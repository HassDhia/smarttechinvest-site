  "hero": "Low, three-quarter angle of an operator and a studio producer leaning over a dim workbench, arranging a scaled parade float, matte black tracking tags, and a paper timing grid to imply a coordinated seasonal burst (parade / Black Friday). Deep charcoal negative space and a single warm rim light pick out brushed steel tools and the operators’ hands, suggesting staged discount timing and front-loaded campaign strategy. Composition cues: low-angle, subject-centered hands and objects, materials: brushed steel, matte paper, black leather; moody, high-contrast lighting that reads operational choreography and agentic orchestration without any literal UI.",
  "signal_map": "45° top-down vignette of an abstract signal map: brass pins, glass beads, and vellum strips radiating from a central marble token to represent compressed seasonal spikes, early-access cohorts, and outlet surges. Heavy negative space, shallow depth, and a single cool backlight cast long shadows; composition cues: top-down/angled plane, materials: brass, glass, matte vellum, textured felt to suggest measurable pathways without screens.",
  "case_studies": [
    "Mid-shot of an operator placing a timed coupon tag onto a miniature storefront diorama while a producer cues a mechanical stopwatch; tight crop on hands and objects to evoke a two-week coordinated campaign test. Composition cues: three-quarter angle, reclaimed wood diorama, matte paper tags, steel stopwatch, narrow spotlight and deep negative space—signals S1, S2 and S6 (seasonal burst, front-loaded deals, agentic orchestration) without literal screens.",
    "Intimate flat-lay/30° tilt of a pop-up planning table with handcrafted shop tokens, family bundle wristbands, and a pinned local map annotated with social-mention tags; warm lamplight and heavy shadows create a moody, tactile scene. Composition cues: printed linen, brass pins, rubber wristbands, tight negative space—conveys S3 and S4 (local discovery and family experiential bundles) and the pilot/test mindset."
