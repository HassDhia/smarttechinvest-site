The stopwatch symbolizes tightly timed campaigns — Macy’s Parade and Black Friday weekend, staged discounting, early‑access cohorts and paid‑social mini‑bursts linked by a single tracking URL — while leaving the top 25% empty for a magazine‑cover header.. dark-mode editorial photography, charcoal + cyan palette, dramatic edge lighting, single subject, generous negative space, cinematic contrast, not a poster, not a collage, not an infographic, no charts, no UI, no labels",
