ArXiv authors propose an interaction variable for microgrids that unifies instantaneous power and generalized reactive power, demonstrate it on a simple RLC demonstrator, and state sufficient stability conditions for Feedback Linearizing Control (FBLC) and Sliding Mode Control (SMC). A concurrent correction to foundational consensus literature tightens coordination guarantees. For operators the paper implies a layered control shift: enact systemwide interaction-variable targets, deploy resilient consensus primitives, and field certified edge FBLC/SMC firmware with upgraded sensing, synchronized telemetry, and HIL testbeds; maintain local fail‑safe controllers to address model mismatch and SMC chattering. For investors the signal favors control software, validation labs, edge compute and SoC vendors, and integrators with theory‑backed hardware validation and standards ties; incumbents built on legacy consensus assumptions face revaluation risk. For business development the opportunity is to sell a bundled product of interaction‑variable APIs, certified FBLC/SMC SDKs, HIL certification services, and managed pilot deployments for campuses and industrial microgrids. Immediate recommended actions: execute RLC and HIL pilots, validate FBLC/SMC parameters under adversarial networks, pursue standards engagement, and commercialize certified firmware plus managed validation to capture premium pricing and reduce operational risk. Early adopters who prove stability at scale will gain regulatory trust and durable commercial advantage and customers.
