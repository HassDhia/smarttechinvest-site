# Early-holiday footfall: local media as a sales channel
_You need to lift store visits and buyer share in the Nov 28–Dec 12 window without blanket discounts_

> Short test: use local public-media sponsorships plus hyper-local CTV and in-store QR events to target **10-15%** incremental visits and protect CPA; ask to lock station-level tracking within 30 days.

Several local public stations now offer fast-turn sponsorships and station-level promo codes or QR pages, which we can use to link exposure to visits. Programmatic local CTV gives repeatable household reach inside 25-mile store clusters. At the same time the math on running blanket discounts for the early holiday window looks poor: margin leakage with little measured lift in buyer share. That creates a narrow, measurable opening to test a media-led local approach instead of deeper promos.

If you are running stores, **run the pilot**: a two-week, six-store test in geo clusters from Nov 28 to Dec 12 pairing short public-radio sponsorships, local CTV, and QR-enabled in-store events. Use station-specific promo codes or QR landing pages to tie impressions to measured visits and run matched control areas to attribute lift. I recommend the store-as-studio / media-led holiday approach because it trades visible, attributable media for discounting while keeping spend and CPA guarded. Keep daily pacing and a single measurement spine so we see lift and attribution quickly.

Hitting a **10-15%** foot-traffic lift in the early window would feel like an extra busy Saturday across the six stores — more buyers, fuller registers, and clearer product trial without margin-killing coupons. Stretching to **≥25%** would change staffing and stock priorities for the season and justify scaling media buys. Raising early-window buyer share from ~12-15% to **20-30%** concentrates incremental sales into higher-margin days rather than across the whole holiday run.

The first failure mode is attribution breakage: if station codes or QR pages are misconfigured we see impressions but no tied visits. Second, geo bleed or panel noise on local CTV can dilute treatment vs control differences and create false negatives. Third, short-flight CPM spikes could push CPA above the ceiling; watch spend pacing and stop if CPA approaches **<=0.8× baseline** or QR scans fall under **≥5%** of footfall.

This is a bet that short, local media plus in-store events moves visits and buyer share faster than blanket discounts and gives us a clean attribution test. I need Partnerships to lock station-level promos and CTV buys with tracking, Retail to run QR-enabled events and staff the stores, Marketing to execute creative and daily measurement, and Finance to set the spend bands against the CPA guardrail. Approve the two-week Local Operators Media Pilot (Nov 28–Dec 12) across six geo-cluster stores, fund the station-level buys, and hold to the CPA and QR guardrails.

What matters in this window is Local public-media inventory is available now with low negotiation friction; short flights reduce exposure risk and give station-level tracking we can tie to visits., Hyper-local CTV and station codes let us buy measurable frequency inside a store radius so we trade promotional depth for visible, attributable reach during a high-decision window., and The early holiday window concentrates buyers; proving incremental share here means smaller, profitable promotions later and preserves margin.

The numbers I would watch: Foot traffic uplift: **10-15%** incremental visits measured treatment vs control during the **Nov 28–Dec 12** two-week window.; Early-window buyer share: move from ~12–15% to **20-30%** of buyers within the **Nov 28–Dec 12** window.; Guardrails: event CPA at or below **<=0.8× baseline** and QR redemption at or above **≥5%** of measured footfall during the **Nov 28–Dec 12** flight.

If that resonates, Approve the two-week Local Operators Media Pilot (Nov 28–Dec 12) across six geo-cluster stores, fund the station-level buys, and hold to the CPA and QR guardrails.
