  "abstract": "You must lift store foot traffic and buyer share in the early holiday window without blanket discounts, and deliver measurable results inside two planning cycles. Target **10-15%** foot-traffic uplift with a stretch goal of **≥25%**, grow early-window share from current 12–15% toward **20-30%**, and hold event CPA at or below **0.80×** baseline while driving at least 5% QR redemption of footfall. Favor a store-as-studio / media-led holiday that pairs local public media sponsorships with programmatic hyper-local CTV; partnerships, procurement, and store ops must secure Nov 28–Dec 12 short flights with station-level promo codes or QR landing pages in the next 30 days so you can measure incremental footfall and CPA. Measure success by tracking buyer activity share versus promo intensity and QR redemptions per geo, using matched control areas for attribution [^2][^3][^4][^8].",
