  "executive_summary": "This program pairs early-access windows with pop-up activations to hit the unified holiday target pack—**detectable foot-traffic uplift 10–15% (stretch goal ≥25% in top markets)**, **early-window transaction share 20–30% (vs ~12–15% baseline)**, **event CPA ≤0.80× baseline**, and **QR/scan redemption ≥5% of footfall**.[^3][^4][^1] The test is framed as an A/B inside the same two‑week window: Arm A runs legacy markdowns while Arm B offers bundles + GWP + loyalty enrollment to determine which approach drives earlier conversion and better post-visit economics.[^2][^1] In the **next 30 days** collaboration teams must finalize the A/B creative and measurement plan, instrument door counts and QR→POS links, secure BNPL/cashback and GWP logistics, schedule opening‑weekend staffing and post‑visit outreach, and lock analytics for eight‑week cohort tracking.[^4][^3]",
