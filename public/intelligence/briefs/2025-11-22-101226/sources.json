Dive Brief: Value for money is the most important factor for consumers when it comes to holiday purchases, followed by product quality and discounts, according to data from Mastercard’s Shopper Snapshot shared with Marketing Dive. With the focus placed squarely on value, sales and discounts have become a driving force when it comes to consumer purchases. Among survey respondents, 73% routinely purchase a wish list item once it goes on sale, 71% respond to personalized discount codes and 63% act when limited-time sales are ending. Consumers are using artificial intelligence as a digital helping hand this holiday season. Approximately half of Gen Z and millennials would let AI handle gift buying if it meant avoiding holiday stress. Additionally, 42% of consumers are already using the technology to assist with buying gifts Dive Insight: With consumers starting their holiday shopping earlier and earlier, marketers have been focused on timing campaigns to capture buyer attention. Brands have taken a variety of approaches. For example, Home Depot tugged at heartstrings with ads showcasing Christmas tree farmers while Walmart tapped into seasonal nostalgia with ads featuring the Grinch. However, data from Mastercard found above all else, consumers are looking for value this holiday season. Mastercard’s “Shopper Snapshot 2025: Holiday Shopping Insights” report is based on responses from 4,007 consumers from the U.S., Canada, the U.K and the UAE. It was conducted in partnership with The Harris Poll. Consumers are looking to cash in on rewards this season, with 79% of respondents planning on using loyalty points and rewards to complete purchases. The hunt for value could provide a way to collect first party data, with 66% of respondents saying they regularly provide their contact information in order to receive a discount during the holidays, per the report. Social commerce is becoming a more trusted outlet for consumers, with 57% of Gen Z and 61% of millennials saying their trust in the channel has increased. Additionally, 53% of Gen Z consumers and 47% of millennials report trusting the opinion of influencers over their own friends.

Search Search A Tale of Two Pop-Ups: Amazon, Primark Aim to Capture NYC Holiday Magic November 18, 2025 at 11:09 AM EST By Nicole Silberstein Inside Amazon's Home for the Holidays pop-up in NYC. (Retail TouchPoints) The holiday season is replete with holly, garland, sales…and pop-ups, especially in high-traffic tourist destinations like New York City. This year, two takes on the holiday pop-up, from Amazon and Primark , present an interesting study of the model’s variability and utility. The two companies took markedly different approaches to their pop-up experiences, although neither activation supported on-site sales. Online-only Amazon highlighted its Holiday Shop offerings in a richly decorated, three -story, three -day pop-up adjacent to tourist hotspot Bryant Park., Primark has opened a small “Studio” space in the NYU-dominated NoHo neighborhood that will remain open through the holidays and beyond, aimed at building buzz for the Spring 2026 opening of its Herald Square flagship . Two very different companies (not least because one dominates U.S. ecommerce and the other has no ecommerce at all) with two very different goals, and yet they both turned to non-transactional pop-ups to achieve their aims. Here’s how these varying expressions of the pop-up model played out. Amazon Brings its Holiday Shop to Life The “home theater” room in Amazon’s Home for the Holidays pop-up. (Retail TouchPoints) Amazon’s first-ever “Home for the Holidays Social Content Studio” was staged from Nov 10-14 at GH on the Park , an event space that at one point in time, long ago, was a stately home overlooking Bryant Park. For the event, Amazon transformed the three stories of the space back into a home, albeit with a modern bent. Advertisement Fully decorated themed rooms included a kitchen and walk-in pantry, dining room, “boudoir” lounge area, playroom, theater, home office and gym. Each area was stuffed to the brim with products from Amazon’s Holiday Shop , with QR codes placed throughout to “shop” the products on display. Image: Retail TouchPoints However, the goal of the event wasn’t sales. Rather, it was a chance for Amazon to break out from the expansive yet restrictive walls of the internet. The pop-up goal was to bring Amazon’s online assortment to life for media and influencers, all busily preparing their holiday hot lists and seasonal shopping recommendations. The idea was to create an immersive experience (which it certainly was) that not only allowed for product trials but also created opportunities for content creation and “photo moments.” Amazon also took the opportunity to highlight its climate-friendly product offerings with a dedicated sustainability section that featured products from its Climate Pledge Friendly program and Amazon Resale , including a curated Climate Pledge Fashion Edit available on Amazon-owned Shopbop . Primark Builds Buzz for Herald Square Store Image: Retail TouchPoints Downtown, Primark hosted its own very different pop-up, the Primark Studio, at 55 Great Jones Street in NoHo. The ",
