The corpus demonstrates that physics‑aware, multi‑layer distributed control—anchored by a unified interaction variable quantifying instantaneous active power (W) and generalized reactive power (VAR)—enables intermediate VAR/W supervisory commands realized by deterministic low‑level controllers (FBLC/SMC). Simple RLC and quadcopter prototypes validate stability and feasibility; quaternion state‑feedback and control allocation enable singularity‑free large‑attitude control for thrust‑vectoring UAVs. For operators, this requires rearchitecting SCADA/DERMS to treat VAR/W setpoints as first‑class outputs, deploy topology‑aware distributed observers, enforce deterministic communications (PTP/IEC 61850/private 5G), and adopt staged rollouts with hardware‑in‑the‑loop verification and provable stability audits. For investors, prioritize inverter and power‑semiconductor manufacturers, edge compute/deterministic comms, and middleware firms enabling VAR→V/A mapping; value firms that can demonstrate certified stability and recurring firmware services. For BD, focus on middleware, retrofit kits, firmware licensing, and verification‑as‑a‑service; pursue pilots with utilities and microgrids to capture VAR/ancillary revenue. Immediate recommended actions: fund controlled pilots, require provable stability in procurement, standardize intermediate‑command interfaces, invest in sensors/time‑sync, and build OTA/assurance capabilities. These steps de‑risk deployments, unlock new edge revenue streams, and shift market power toward physics‑aware platform providers. Stakeholders should track pilot KPIs, semiconductor capacity expansions, and certification milestones to time investments and partnerships while actively mitigating cybersecurity and supply‑chain concentration risks.
