  "executive_summary": "Concentrate flagship promotions into a mid-November early-access window to concentrate high-intent visits and make uplift measurable [^5][^2]. Design the test to detect 10–15% foot-traffic uplift versus baseline for windowed pop-ups and in-store activations, based on observed pilot ranges in recent pop-up programs [^3][^8]. Target early-deal share of 20–30% of holiday transactions (versus roughly 12–15% last year) by replacing at least one sitewide markdown with product bundles, GWP, and a loyalty-member early-access discount [^5][^2]. In the next 30 days merchandising, operations, and local partnerships must lock inventory allocations, finalize short-term window leases, and instrument QR/POS attribution and A/B cohorts so conversion, AOV and margin metrics are captured end-to-end [^2][^3][^1].",

    "Secure a short-term window or pop-up, install QR-linked offers and POS attribution, and confirm staffing and fulfillment plans."
