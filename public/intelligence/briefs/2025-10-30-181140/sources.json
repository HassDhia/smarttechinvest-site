Evidence: “The higher layer design utilizes the interactive energy state-space model to derive intermediate reactive power control, which becomes a control command to the lower layer physical model... implemented using either Feedback Linearizing Control (FBLC) or Sliding Mode Control (SMC).”",

    "headline": "2025-10-30 — arXiv.org preprint authors (quadcopter paper) replaced Euler-angle based attitude feedback with quaternion state feedback, removing trigonometric parameters from the estimator (reduction = 100% of those trigonometric parameters). Evidence: “Hence, quaternion state feedback is utilized... The quaternion implementation also reduces the overall complexity of state estimation due to absence of trigonometric parameters.”",
