Recent preprints demonstrate a shift toward control‑centric value: an interaction‑variable energy state‑space maps instantaneous and reactive power into higher‑layer VAR commands validated on an RLC micro‑benchmark and implementable via Feedback Linearizing Control or Sliding Mode Control; quaternion state‑feedback replaces Euler angles in over‑actuated UAVs, eliminating trigonometric estimator terms and singularities; and disruptor‑agnostic consensus filters improve resilience without topology knowledge. Operators should treat VAR as a first‑class supervisory setpoint, extend EMS/SCADA semantics, deploy deterministic edge compute for FBLC/SMC, adopt quaternion attitude loops, and scale HIL/digital‑twin tests beyond single‑circuit validation while implementing fallback controllers and intrusion detection. Investors should overweight software, integrator, and verification plays—EMS/DERMS, control‑IP licensors, HIL platforms, and cybersecurity—while de‑emphasizing commodity hardware; prioritize firms with fielded FBLC/SMC proofs and repeatable pilots. Business development should wedge VAR‑to‑controller translation toolchains, quaternion IP bundles, and resilient consensus middleware, partnering with inverter OEMs, UAV OEMs, cloud HIL providers, and security firms. Priority actions: run multi‑node pilots, standardize VAR/telemetry APIs, certify FBLC/SMC and quaternion stacks, and commercialize SLA‑backed monitoring and validation services to capture recurring value from provable stability and reduced integration risk. Execute staged pilots with partners for certification, sell outcome‑based SLAs, and invest in middleware, cybersecurity, and digital‑twin scale‑up to accelerate commercial adoption.
