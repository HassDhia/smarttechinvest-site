  "executive_summary": "Holiday demand is shifting earlier; design a timing test to detect a 10–15% lift in incremental sales for a protected set of SKUs moved into the two weeks before Thanksgiving and measure margin and cannibalization to confirm net gain [^4][^3]. A flagship, parade‑weekend product drop should be instrumented to detect an 8–12% uplift in foot traffic versus baseline weekend levels and to track conversion and average order value for profitability [^1][^5]. Early-offer share is already growing—design studies to detect a 10–20% increase in early-deal share versus last year and segment by category to identify displacement in high-ticket items [^3][^4]. In the next 30 days merchandising, store operations, and analytics must lock SKU holds and holdout design, enable traffic and POS instrumentation, and agree on reporting windows so pilots can begin on schedule.",
