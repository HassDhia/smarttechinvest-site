    "prompt": "Capture Deciding whether to move a protected set of limited/new SKUs into the two weeks before Thanksgiving to capture early intent (lift vs. cannibalization and margin preservation).. Scene: Dim backstage-studio hybrid: matte black worktable against a deep charcoal backdrop, negative space around subjects, hints of concrete and stage curtains.. Persona: Store operations lead and studio producer in collaboration — two silhouettes leaning across the table (operator with a worn utility jacket; studio producer with a linen notebook).. Action: Hands arrange a short run of physical SKU samples and handwritten cohort cards; a second hand lifts a translucent play sheet into the light to compare sequences.. Urgency symbol: A taut, thin filament stretched between two lit panes that frays into fine sparks where the decision will 'snap' — symbolic tension indicating timing sensitivity without a clock.. Key objects: matte-wrapped SKU samples tagged 'S1' (early-availability test), small marquee token 'S2' (flagship drop), branded pop-up swatch 'S3', brushed-steel data tag 'S4' (AI pricing pilot), demo badge 'S5' (high-ticket promo), handwritten A/B cohort cards, single-page printouts. Lighting: Moody, low-key dark-mode: deep shadows, a single cool tungsten key on the samples, rim light to separate silhouettes, heavy negative space.. Mood: Tense, disciplined collaboration — calculated risk framed as creative problem solving.. Props: matte-wrapped SKU samples tagged 'S1' (early-availability test), small marquee token 'S2' (flagship drop), branded pop-up swatch 'S3', brushed-steel data tag 'S4' (AI pricing pilot), demo badge 'S5' (high-ticket promo), handwritten A/B cohort cards, single-page printouts. dark-mode editorial photography, charcoal + cyan palette, dramatic edge lighting, single subject, generous negative space, cinematic contrast, not a poster, not a collage, not an infographic, no charts, no UI, no labels",

    "prompt": "Structure: Concentric rings with radial arcs and a sparse lattice — tokens sit on an outer ring (campaign moves) with arcs pulling inward toward a central ledger plane.. Motion: Subtle inward pull: arcs pulse toward the central ledger with staggered timing; one arc shows a slower pull (cannibalization risk) while another spikes quickly (early-lift signal).. dark-mode editorial photography, charcoal + cyan palette, dramatic edge lighting, single subject, generous negative space, cinematic contrast, not a poster, not a collage, not an infographic, no charts, no UI, no labels",

Moment: Minutes before a limited-hours product drop on parade weekend — operator checks inventory tag while studio producer frames the storefront silhouette.. Persona: Flagship floor manager (wearing a canvas apron) and studio director (holding a slate) exchange a terse nod.. Mood: Crisp anticipation — high-footfall theatre with measured operational control.. Lighting: Side-lit tungsten creating long shadows, focused rim light on the locked SKU chest, negative space behind the storefront window.. Props: small locked SKU chest labeled 'S2', countdown baton (symbolic tension via light fade rather than numbers), two walkie-headsets resting on matte paper. dark-mode editorial photography, charcoal + cyan palette, dramatic edge lighting, single subject, generous negative space, cinematic contrast, not a poster, not a collage, not an infographic, no charts, no UI, no labels",

Persona: Field operator in a weathered parka and brand partnership producer with a fabric swatchbook.. Mood: Calculated optimism — testing cultural lift in a controlled urban frame.. Lighting: Moody street-warm backlight with a single cool fill on the pop-up model; heavy negative margins to emphasize passersby absence/presence..
