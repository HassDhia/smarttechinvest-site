We will run a two-week early-access test against a unified holiday target pack: detectable foot-traffic uplift **10–15%** (stretch **≥25%** in top markets), early-window transaction share **20–30%** (baseline ~12–15%), event CPA ≤**0.80×** baseline, and QR/scan redemption ≥**5%** of footfall. The mechanism is simple: concentrated early access plus a bundle+GWP+loyalty arm repositions value capture into an earlier window and compresses CPA versus legacy markdowns; Arm A is legacy markdowns while Arm B is bundle+GWP+loyalty inside the same two-week window. Collaboration teams must **align merchandising, stores, CRM, and analytics and lock inventories and creative within 30 days** to run the A/B, instrument door counts and QR→POS links, and set clear holdouts for measurement [^5][^8][^9].
