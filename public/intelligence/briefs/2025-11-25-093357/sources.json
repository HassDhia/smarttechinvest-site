    "content": "[Column] Rowen Pillai: AI becomes key to Black Friday retail strategy - Africa Business Communities Home News Interviews Columns Newsletter Services Contact 21-11-2025 Hits: 418 By Bob Koigi | Channel: artificial-intelligence | Tags: Africa Retail Tech [Column] Rowen Pillai: AI becomes key to Black Friday retail strategy Artificial Intelligence is rapidly transforming how South African consumers prepare for Black Friday, turning shoppers into data-driven decision makers with instant access to price comparisons, deals and product insights. For retailers, the shift raises the stakes for visibility, accuracy and personalized engagement across digital channels. Black Friday period has become a test of digital readiness rather than a simple discount-driven sales spike. South Africans spent more than R30 billion across three major banks in 2024, supported by a 7.7 percent rise in retail trade sales that November. Strategic AI adoption will determine which retailers secure commercial advantage in 2025. AI drives major changes in consumer behaviour Consumers are increasingly turning to generative AI tools to navigate sales events, evolving from casual bargain seekers into deliberate, research-driven shoppers. Surveys indicate that nearly half of global consumers already use or intend to use generative AI during year-end promotions. In some studies, one in three shoppers report plans to use AI for holiday purchases, doubling uptake from the previous year. This shift is reshaping expectations. Customers want instant, personalized recommendations aligned with budgets, preferences and gift recipients. In South Africa, cautious spending behaviour persists, but AI-driven assistance is accelerating product research and deal comparisons. Forty six percent of consumers plan to rely on AI for comparisons this season, while 44 percent expect to use it for identifying deals and researching products. Retailers urged to optimize for AI discovery As consumers increasingly rely on AI systems to search, compare and even complete purchases, retailers must ensure their offers are accurately represented in AI-generated responses. Pillai Online visibility now equates to digital shelf space, and retailers risk being overlooked if AI tools fail to surface their offers. I outline three AI-focused strategies for commercial success. First, Answer Engine Optimization requires retailers to provide clear, structured information that enables AI assistants to deliver direct answers to product-related queries. Second, structured and accurate product data—including specifications, reviews and sustainability details—must be machine-readable to ensure consistent representation across platforms. Third, embedding AI tools into the customer experience, such as personalized gift finders or deal assistants, will help brands meet growing expectations for tailored interactions. AI becomes essential across the extended Black Friday cycle Black Friday has expanded into a prolonged sales period, often stretching to ten weeks. This places pressure on retailers to manage pre-event research phases, the peak rush and the extended gift-buying aftermath. AI can support each stage by improving forecasting, personalization and customer engagement. Affordability remains a priority for South African shoppers, with BuyNowPayLater options gaining traction. Responsible lending requires advanced analytics and AI models capable of using trended credit data and income estimation to ensure strong approval quality under financial pressure. AI strengthens fraud prevention and customer experience With transaction volumes rising, retailers face heightened digital fraud attempts, including AI-driven impersonation and document manipulation. A layered defence, supported by identity verification, device intelligence and selective friction, is essential. AI plays a key role in identifying suspicious patterns and protecting both retailers and customers. Customer experience remains central. Automated confi",
