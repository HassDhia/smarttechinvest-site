  "executive_summary": "We will run a two-week early-access test against a unified holiday target pack: detectable foot-traffic uplift **10–15%** (stretch **≥25%** in top markets), early-window transaction share **20–30%** (baseline ~12–15%), event CPA ≤**0.80×** baseline, and QR/scan redemption ≥**5%** of footfall. The mechanism is simple: concentrated early access plus a bundle+GWP+loyalty arm repositions value capture into an earlier window and compresses CPA versus legacy markdowns; Arm A is legacy markdowns while Arm B is bundle+GWP+loyalty inside the same two-week window. Collaboration teams must **align merchandising, stores, CRM, and analytics and lock inventories and creative within 30 days** to run the A/B, instrument door counts and QR→POS links, and set clear holdouts for measurement [^5][^8][^9].",
  "top_operator_moves": [
    "Immediate (0–30 days): Stand up the two-week A/B in top markets. Lock inventory splits, creative, store staffing, QR codes, and an analytics holdout. Instrument door counts and QR→POS before launch.",
    "Positioning (quarter-scale): Scale Arm B bundle+GWP+loyalty to the top 25 stores and matched online; prioritize stores hitting **≥10%** initial uplift for incremental allocation.",
    "Compounding (long-tail): Convert high-performing bundle experiences into a 6-week micro-drop cadence tied to loyalty triggers and local pop-up partnerships to sustain early-window share."
