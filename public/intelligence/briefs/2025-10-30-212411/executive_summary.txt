Recent ArXiv contributions introduce an interaction variable that explicitly quantifies instantaneous active power (W) and a generalized reactive‑power metric (VAR), and demonstrate a hierarchical control flow where a higher‑layer interactive energy state‑space issues intermediate VAR commands to lower‑layer controllers, validated on a single RLC circuit and implemented with FBLC/SMC. A separate correction note revising Olfati‑Saber et al. raises theoretical and validation requirements. Implications: operators must treat the new variable and VAR command as a control‑plane asset—updating DERMS/SCADA, increasing telemetry rates, hardening low‑latency secure channels, and implementing staged commissioning, canary fleets, rollback and cyber incident playbooks. Investors should rotate capital toward inverter OEMs, control‑software vendors, deterministic compute semiconductors, and verification/test labs while de‑risking firms built on uncorrected consensus assumptions. Business development opportunities include VAR‑as‑a‑service, retrofit FBLC/SMC firmware kits, and independent proof‑of‑stability packages; pursue OEM partnerships, utility pilots, and standards engagement to expedite procurement acceptance. Recommended actions: run phased HIL/SIL and field pilots with formal verification, require vendor certification milestones, embed authenticated VAR command channels and anomaly detection, and prioritize partnerships that accelerate certification and field data. These steps capture value from faster ancillary services while mitigating theoretical, operational, and cyber risk. Act now: pilot, certify, secure to protect systems and revenue.
