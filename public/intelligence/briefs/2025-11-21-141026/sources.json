I grew up watching neighbors guard their cooking methods like treasure maps, passing down techniques through hushed conversations at church suppers and county fairs. These dishes aren’t about impressing food critics; they’re about feeding families, celebrating harvests, and honoring the immigrant roots that shaped this state’s culinary identity. Mention any of these eighteen recipes to an Iowan, and you’ll witness fierce loyalty mixed with childhood nostalgia. That is why they are so special. 1. Breaded Pork Tenderloin Sandwich © – Let’s Go Iowa Pounded until it’s practically transparent, this pork loin gets a thick breading coat before hitting hot oil. The result hangs over the bun like an edible umbrella, demanding respect and a strategy for eating. Every Iowa diner has its own take, but the non-negotiables remain: pickles, onions, and a smear of yellow mustard. I once tried to order mine without pickles at a truck stop near Cedar Rapids, and the waitress looked at me like I’d insulted her grandmother. The sheer size makes it Instagram-worthy, but locals have been devouring these long before social media existed. 2. Steak de Burgo © Carne Diem Des Moines claims this tenderloin treasure, and the city defends it fiercely. Chunks of beef swim in a garlic-butter sauce spiked with Italian herbs, creating a dish that feels fancy without requiring a tuxedo. Most restaurants serve it with a crusty bread for soaking up every drop of that garlicky goodness. I remember my first bite at a downtown steakhouse, wondering why this hadn’t conquered the entire Midwest yet. It’s proof that Iowa can do upscale comfort food when the mood strikes, elevating simple ingredients into something memorable. 3. Hot Beef Sundae © WG MeatBox Someone in Iowa looked at roast beef, mashed potatoes, and gravy, then decided to stack them like dessert. The result sits somewhere between brilliant and bizarre, served in a glass with a cherry tomato perched on top instead of a maraschino. County fairs and festivals embrace this quirky creation, and locals order it without a trace of irony. The layers mirror an ice cream sundae’s structure, but the savory flavors keep your taste buds thoroughly confused in the best way. It’s comfort food with a sense of humor. 4. Sloppy Joe Pizza © Thursday Night Pizza Ground beef meets pizza crust meets taco toppings in this Iowa hybrid that shouldn’t work but absolutely does. Seasoned meat spreads across the dough, then gets piled with cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes like a deconstructed taco. My cousin in Sioux City serves this at every family gathering, and the pan empties within minutes. Critics might call it confused, but Iowans call it efficient: why choose between pizza and tacos when you can have both? It’s the culinary equivalent of refusing to pick sides. 5. Sweet Corn on the Cob © Eden Ridge Acres When August rolls around and Iowa’s cornfields reach peak sweetness, locals race to get those ears into boiling water. The fresher the better, ideally picked that same morning and cooked within hours. Butter and salt are the only acceptable additions; anything else is considered agricultural blasphemy. The kernels burst with natural sugar, making Iowa sweet corn a seasonal event people mark on their calendars. Roadside stands pop up everywhere, and families buy by the dozen, knowing these ears won’t last long once the season shifts. 6. Iowa Pork Chop © Dinner at the Zoo Cut thick from the lower b",

Search Search A Tale of Two Pop-Ups: Amazon, Primark Aim to Capture NYC Holiday Magic November 18, 2025 at 11:09 AM EST By Nicole Silberstein Inside Amazon's Home for the Holidays pop-up in NYC. (Retail TouchPoints) The holiday season is replete with holly, garland, sales…and pop-ups, especially in high-traffic tourist destinations like New York City. This year, two takes on the holiday pop-up, from Amazon and Primark , present an interesting study of the model’s variability and utility. The two companies took markedly different approaches to their pop-up experiences, although neither activation supported on-site sales. Online-only Amazon highlighted its Holiday Shop offerings in a richly decorated, three -story, three -day pop-up adjacent to tourist hotspot Bryant Park., Primark has opened a small “Studio” space in the NYU-dominated NoHo neighborhood that will remain open through the holidays and beyond, aimed at building buzz for the Spring 2026 opening of its Herald Square flagship . Two very different companies (not least because one dominates U.S. ecommerce and the other has no ecommerce at all) with two very different goals, and yet they both turned to non-transactional pop-ups to achieve their aims. Here’s how these varying expressions of the pop-up model played out. Amazon Brings its Holiday Shop to Life The “home theater” room in Amazon’s Home for the Holidays pop-up. (Retail TouchPoints) Amazon’s first-ever “Home for the Holidays Social Content Studio” was staged from Nov 10-14 at GH on the Park , an event space that at one point in time, long ago, was a stately home overlooking Bryant Park. For the event, Amazon transformed the three stories of the space back into a home, albeit with a modern bent. Advertisement Fully decorated themed rooms included a kitchen and walk-in pantry, dining room, “boudoir” lounge area, playroom, theater, home office and gym. Each area was stuffed to the brim with products from Amazon’s Holiday Shop , with QR codes placed throughout to “shop” the products on display. Image: Retail TouchPoints However, the goal of the event wasn’t sales. Rather, it was a chance for Amazon to break out from the expansive yet restrictive walls of the internet. The pop-up goal was to bring Amazon’s online assortment to life for media and influencers, all busily preparing their holiday hot lists and seasonal shopping recommendations. The idea was to create an immersive experience (which it certainly was) that not only allowed for product trials but also created opportunities for content creation and “photo moments.” Amazon also took the opportunity to highlight its climate-friendly product offerings with a dedicated sustainability section that featured products from its Climate Pledge Friendly program and Amazon Resale , including a curated Climate Pledge Fashion Edit available on Amazon-owned Shopbop . Primark Builds Buzz for Herald Square Store Image: Retail TouchPoints Downtown, Primark hosted its own very different pop-up, the Primark Studio, at 55 Great Jones Street in NoHo. The ",
