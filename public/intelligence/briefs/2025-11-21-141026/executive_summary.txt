Operators should execute a unified holiday target pack: **10–15%** detectable foot‑traffic uplift (stretch goal **≥25%** in top markets), an early‑window transaction share goal of **20–30%** (vs **~12–15%** baseline), Event CPA target **≤0.80×** baseline, and QR/scan redemption **≥5%** of footfall. The test will be framed as Arm A (legacy markdown) vs Arm B (bundle+GWP+loyalty) inside the same two‑week window to isolate offer mechanics and incremental loyalty lift. Collaboration teams must, within **30 days**, finalize offers and staffing, instrument door counts/QR→POS and payment→loyalty mapping, and stand up an A/B holdout plus daily reporting to track attribution and hit the targets [^1][^4][^3].
