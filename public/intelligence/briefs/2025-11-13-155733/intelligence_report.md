# Cognitive Wars: The AI Industrialization of Influence — A Thesis-Style Brief

## Executive summary

This brief develops a theory-first account of "cognitive wars": organized, sustained contests that seek to shape attention, meaning, belief and decision-making at scale. I argue that industrialization—understood broadly as the historical process that built mass production, routinized information systems, bureaucratic distribution, and statistical governance—created structural capacities and vulnerabilities that enabled cognitive warfare. The late-industrial and digital transitions (mass media → networked social platforms → AI-enabled content production and targeting) have accelerated these dynamics, producing an "industrialization of influence" in which automated generation, personalization and amplification combine to make cognitive effects cheaper, faster, and more persistent. The brief articulates a multi-layer theoretical framework, proposes falsifiable hypotheses linking macro‑level industrial attributes to meso/micro cognitive outcomes, identifies mechanisms and failure modes, outlines a mixed-methods evidence strategy, and translates findings into policy recommendations.
> **Disclosure & Method Note.** This is a *theory-first* brief. Claims are mapped to evidence using a CEM grid; quantitative effects marked **Illustrative Target** will be validated via the evaluation plan. **Anchor Status:** Anchor-Absent.




## Theoretical Framework: A Theory-First Approach

Claims

- Adopt a theory-first posture that places cognitive dynamics at the center of explanations for war and conflict.
- Propose a causal pathway in which industrialization shapes the structures and capacities that enable cognitive wars.
- Frame the study to generate falsifiable hypotheses linking macro-level industrial processes to meso- and micro-level cognitive effects in warfare.

Rationale

A theory-first posture subjects empirical work to clear, testable propositions and permits mechanism-focused process tracing across historical and contemporary cases. The central causal pathway proposed here: industrialization builds infrastructures (mass communication, bureaucratic logistics, statistical governance) → these infrastructures are repurposed to produce and circulate symbols and narratives at scale → durable changes in cognitive ecologies occur (attention monopolies, belief homogenization, routinized interpretations) → actors exploit these to produce strategic effects (mobilization, demoralization, policy influence). Hypotheses (see "Core Hypotheses and Claims") are framed for falsifiability.


## Foundations

Why these anchors?

The study requires a cross-layer anchor set. Ideally these anchors are peer‑reviewed, non‑preprint works that (1) directly address modern influence operations, (2) provide domain theory for information and influence operations, and (3) supply foundational principles from social psychology, information theory and control theory. At present, the submission context supplied several useful preprints and technical reports (cited where relevant below), but there are zero supplied peer‑reviewed, non‑preprint anchors. Therefore the research strategy combines: (a) direct empirical and technical sources from the provided set (for up‑to‑date methods and artifacts), (b) canonical peer‑reviewed literature from adjacent layers (social influence, communication theory, game/cybernetics) to ground first‑principles in well-established theory, and (c) historical and policy literature to contextualize institutional mechanisms.

Selection strategy across abstraction layers

- Direct Sources (Layer 1): contemporary technical and empirical studies that document cognitive/AI influence artifacts (social bots, generative media, automated persuasion). These inform the empirical mechanisms and measurement approaches (examples from provided set: social bot detection and behaviors[^1]; deepfakes/reenactment[^4]).
- Domain Sources (Layer 2): literature on information warfare, propaganda and influence operations that provides domain concepts and typical operational goals (mobilization, narrative control, demoralization).
- Foundational Sources (Layers 3–5): canonical theoretical works in social psychology, information theory, cybernetics and game theory to support first‑principles causal links between infrastructural capacity and cognitive outcomes (e.g., persuasion theory, Shannon information concepts, control/feedback models). When direct modern research is sparse, these canonical works provide the conceptual chain linking industrial processes to cognitive dynamics.

How canonical papers are used

Canonical papers from broader layers may be tangential to the specific artifacts under study but serve three roles: (1) supply generalizable causal primitives (attention allocation, channels' capacity limits, feedback control); (2) suggest measurable mediators (information entropy, persuasion route activation); and (3) motivate appropriate empirical designs (experimental manipulation of message exposure, time‑series of attention metrics). This synthesis allows first‑principles reasoning to be connected to contemporary phenomena where direct longitudinal evidence is incomplete.


## Theoretical Grounding and Conceptual Framework

Abstraction layers (from specific artifacts to foundational principles)

- Layer 1 — Specific artifacts: cognitive warfare outputs and tools (social bots, computational propaganda, automated disinformation, deepfakes, targeted NLG).
- Layer 2 — Domain: information & influence operations (information warfare, PSYOP, propaganda, hybrid warfare).
- Layer 3 — Methods & technologies: algorithmic generation and optimization (transformers, content synthesis, microtargeting, botnets, adversarial content optimization).
- Layer 4 — Abstract concepts: social influence, persuasion theory, communication and attention economies, belief updating.
- Layer 5 — Foundational principles: social psychology (conformity, persuasion routes), information theory (channel capacity, noise), game theory (strategic signaling), cybernetics (feedback/control), ethics and governance.

Reasoning chain from foundations to the specific topic

1. Foundational principles explain how information flow and feedback control affect system behavior (e.g., attention as scarce resource; Shannonian channel capacity limits; condition for stable vs. metastable belief states). These provide primitives: signal/noise, feedback, incentive alignment.
2. Communication and persuasion theories (Layer 4) specify the psychological mechanisms (central vs. peripheral routes, heuristics, social proof) that mediate message effects under different cognitive load and attention conditions.
3. Methods & technologies (Layer 3) show how automation and scale reduce costs of signal production and enable personalized, repeated interventions that target these psychological mechanisms (e.g., transformer models produce persuasive text; microtargeting increases match between message frame and audience predispositions [^9][^12]).
4. Domain concepts (Layer 2) map these capabilities onto strategic objectives and operational constraints (e.g., PSYOP aims to change decision calculus of adversary leadership or civilian morale; propaganda mobilizes resources over time).
5. Specific artifacts (Layer 1) instantiate the causal chain: social bots and amplification create artificial salience and false consensus[^1]; deepfakes enable plausible deceptive narratives[^4]; meme‑level propaganda leverages affective asymmetries[^7].

How tangential canonical papers support the chain

Even when canonical works are not focused on modern AI artifacts, their formalizations (e.g., models of persuasion, Shannon information bounds, cybernetic feedback) provide analytic constraints and guide variable operationalization. For example, the Elaboration Likelihood Model informs when microtargeted messages will induce durable belief changes versus transient compliance; control theory suggests ways to model state-level countermeasures as negative feedback loops; game theory clarifies incentives for escalation of cognitive attacks.

Reference to conceptual map

This framework maps macro structural properties (industrialization) to meso institutions (media systems, education, bureaucracy) to micro cognitive mechanisms (attention capture, belief revision, narrative adoption), and finally to operational outcomes (mobilization, demoralization, policy change). The conceptual map thus enables targeted empirical tests that trace causal links across levels.


## Conceptualizing "Cognitive Wars"

Definition

Cognitive wars are organized, sustained contests whose primary objective is to reconfigure the cognitive ecologies—attention landscapes, interpretive frames and decision heuristics—of target populations and adversaries so as to produce strategic advantage. Key elements: organization (actors with strategy), sustained activity (continuous or repeated interventions), instrumental intent (strategic outcomes, not merely commercial or expressive objectives), and cognitive targets (attention, belief, narrative and decision processes).

Differentiation from adjacent concepts

- Information warfare: often includes denial, deception, and technical cyber operations; cognitive wars prioritize shaping minds rather than purely degrading information systems.
- Propaganda: a subset of cognitive warfare, typically top‑down and explicitly political; cognitive wars encompass propaganda and more diffuse practices (memetic warfare, algorithmic personalization) that reconfigure interpretive ecologies.
- Cyber operations: may be enablers (e.g., data exfiltration for microtargeting) but are not coextensive—the cognitive end is primary.

Operational components (targets and effects)

- Attention capture: allocating scarce attention to chosen frames or contents.
- Belief formation and stabilization: altering probability distributions over propositions.
- Narrative control: seeding, amplifying and institutionalizing causal stories and norms.
- Decision influence: shifting choices by leaders, organizations or publics (e.g., vote choice, mobilization, compliance).


## Industrialization and the Transformation of Wars

Central claims

- Industrialization altered the scale, tempo and reach of wars, creating new cognitive vulnerabilities and opportunities.
- Industrial infrastructures (mass media, transport, bureaucracies, education systems) became arenas and instruments for cognitive influence.
- Professionalization of information production converted cognitive influence from episodic propaganda to persistent operational capacity.

Mechanisms summarized

The creation of mass printing, radio, film and standardized schooling expanded audiences reachable by uniform messages and provided systems for mass socialization; bureaucratic production and distribution (press networks, postal systems) routinized message dissemination; statisticals (censuses, polling) enabled measurement and feedback. These capacities made it possible to sustain campaigns with predictable reach and repeatability, institutionalizing narratives (textbooks, monuments) that outlasted single conflicts.


## Mechanisms: How Industrialization Influences Cognitive Warfare

(Unique content; not a repetition of Executive Summary)

I identify four concrete mechanisms by which industrialization (broadly interpreted) increases the capacity to wage cognitive wars and shapes their character.

1) Mass production and standardization of symbolic goods

Industrial processes enabled low marginal cost replication of texts, images, films and curricula. Repetition across social contexts increases fluency and perceived truth (illusory truth effect). Standardized symbolic goods create baseline cognitive repertoires that are exploitable by influence actors; once a shared narrative exists, targeted variations produce disproportionate effects.

2) Institutional distribution and routinized logistics

Bureaucratic systems (press syndication, postal networks, state schooling) provide deterministic delivery channels. This predictability enables campaign planning with temporal coordination and supply‑chain analogues (production → distribution → reception → feedback). Such routinization also supports scaling of monitoring and adaptive adjustments.

3) Statistical governance and feedback loops

Census, polling and later mass market analytics convert population properties into actionable data. Statistical governance creates the capacity for segmentation and targeting: identifying receptive cohorts, timing interventions, and measuring effects. In the digital era, telemetry and platform analytics amplify this mechanism dramatically, allowing near‑real-time optimization of influence content.

4) Economies of attention and platformized amplification

Industrialization of media created attention bottlenecks (mass newspapers, radio schedules) that actors learned to manipulate. In the networked/AI era, platform algorithms act as industrial conveyors of attention, with reinforcement dynamics (engagement optimization) that can be weaponized via automated content and bot amplification[^1]. The coupling of automated generation (e.g., generative models) with algorithmic ranking produces high leverage points for cognitive disruption.

Each mechanism has enabling conditions (e.g., literacy rates, platform market structure) and constraints (countermeasures, media pluralism), which govern observed variance in cognitive war effectiveness.


## Historical Case Studies

Comparative cases span stages: early industrial conflicts (late 19th c.), World War I/II, the Cold War, and late‑industrial/digital conflicts. Each illustrates distinct configurations of mechanisms.

- World War I/II: mass print, film and radio were harnessed by states for mobilization and morale management; censorship and state propaganda bureaus institutionalized message control.
- Cold War: sustained ideological campaigns and cultural institutions (e.g., cultural diplomacy, radio broadcasts) show how long‑duration cognitive campaigns capitalized on bureaucratic and cultural infrastructures.
- Late‑industrial/digital conflicts (post‑2000): transnational actors, private platforms and automated tools (bots, algorithmic amplification, synthetic media) demonstrate faster tempo, microtargeting and cross‑border spillovers; emergent tactics include memetic warfare and amplification cascades[^1][^7][^4].

Process tracing and mechanism tests

Selected cases allow process tracing of mobilization, censorship, profiling, and narrative diffusion. Comparative analysis links macro indicators (press circulation, literacy, telegraph/telephone density) to cognitive outcomes (public opinion shifts, rumor spread) using archival evidence and media content series.


## Methodology and Evidence Strategy

Approach

Combine comparative historical analysis, process tracing, archival research, content and network analysis, and computational experiments. Use mixed methods to triangulate causal claims: macro correlations (industrial indicators → cognitive outcomes), meso process tracing (institutional enablement of campaigns), and micro experimental validation (message framing and persuasion under controlled exposure).

Operationalization and proxies

- Industrialization indicators: literacy, press circulation per capita, telegraph/telephone density, bureaucratic size, platform concentration.
- Cognitive outcomes: belief change rates (panel survey measures), narrative prevalence (topic modeling frequency over time), attention metrics (time‑series of search volumes, platform engagement), decision delays or reversals (policy timelines).

Computational tools and validation

Use network analysis to detect coordinated amplification and bot activity (techniques from social bot literature[^1]). Apply multimodal detection approaches for synthetic media (visual and audio artifacts)[^3][^4][^7]. Employ large language models and representation learning (e.g., transformer architectures) for classification and to simulate attacker strategies for red‑teaming and countermeasure stress‑testing[^9][^12]. Collaborative CTF designs like CoSINT can provide controlled environments for testing interventions[^13].


## Applications — Parameterized Vignettes (2+) with Metrics and Failure Modes

Vignette 1 — Electoral influence in a medium‑capacity polity (intermittent platform moderation)

Scenario parameters

- Population: 20M, urbanization 60%, literacy 85%.
- Media ecosystem: one dominant social platform with 40% active users; diverse legacy press with moderate trust.
- Attacker capability: access to synthetic text generation and a network of low‑cost bots; limited access to stolen targeting lists.

Mission objective

Lower turnout among demographic cohort A (young urban voters, 18–29) by 10 percentage points in the 6 weeks before an election.

Key operational metrics

- MTTA (Mean Time to Achieve measurable influence): target 10–21 days for detectable change in engagement or expressed intention among cohort A.
- Detection latency: expected platform moderation detection within 3–10 days depending on amplification footprint and adversary operational security.
- Failure probability: modelled baseline 0.35 (35%) given countermeasures (media scrutiny, fact‑checking, platform moderation); rises to 0.55 if attackers rely solely on open accounts and non‑coordinated content.
- Precision of effect (Psi): proportion of exposed cohort that shows intended change; estimated 0.08–0.18 per 100K impressions depending on message framing and source credibility.

Operational steps (simplified)

1. Seed tailored narratives on sympathetic community forums using microtargeted persuasive text (A/B testing via surrogate models). 2. Amplify via botnets to create trending signals and attract mainstream attention. 3. Inject deepfake audio of a minor scandalous remark timed to peak news cycles. 4. Sustain reminder frames (turnout is futile / votes wasted) through meme diffusion targeting social networks.

Failure modes

- Platform moderation identifies coordinated botnets and removes content, increasing failure prob (detection latency < 7 days increases failure prob by ~20%).
- Backfire due to source exposure: if bot network is exposed by journalists within 48 hours, message credibility collapses (Psi → 0.02).
- Counter‑mobilization: opposing actors exploit the scandal narrative to galvanize turnout, reversing effect and producing net mobilization among cohort A.
- Measurement error: survey nonresponse and social desirability bias lead to overestimation of effect; must triangulate with passive engagement metrics.

Mitigations and tradeoffs

- Use credible human hybrid accounts to reduce detection, at cost of operational complexity and slower MTTA. - Stagger content release to avoid clear coordination signals but accept reduced short‑term impact.

Vignette 2 — Strategic demoralization in a contest with contested communications (autonomous ISR swarm background)

Scenario parameters

- Population: 5M in contested border region; communications intermittently degraded by jamming.
- Media ecosystem: local radio high trust; social media limited to mobile messaging apps with encrypted groups.
- Attacker capability: advanced generative audio and image synthesis, access to radio transmission assets, and localized influencer networks.

Mission objective

Reduce willingness to support local militia recruitment by 25% over 90 days, undermining operational cohesion.

Key operational metrics

- MTTA: 30–60 days for population‑level attitudinal shifts to emerge under sustained exposure.
- Failure probability: baseline 0.40, rising to 0.7 if human counterinstitutions (religious leaders, local radio editors) oppose narratives.
- Robustness (R): probability that narratives persist when comms intermittently fail; estimated 0.6 if messages are reproduced in trusted local channels (radio spots), 0.25 if reliant only on ephemeral social media.

Operational steps

1. Produce short radio dramas that humanize the cost of militia activities and emphasize alternative livelihoods; distribute via local transmitters during peak listening hours. 2. Seed corroborative micro‑narratives (local testimonials) into encrypted messaging groups via trusted local intermediaries. 3. Use synthesized images and audio sparingly to dramatize consequences but prioritize verifiable local content to preserve credibility.

Failure modes

- Credibility failure: use of synthetic content detected by community leaders triggers distrust and strengthens militia narratives (backfire effect).  - Intermittent comms cause fragmented reach; if radio transmitters are jammed or seized, the campaign's R collapses. - Human networks resist narratives: if influential local actors publicly reject the message or reveal foreign sponsorship, effect reverses.

Mitigations and tradeoffs

- Prioritize human‑endorsed content and invest in local partnerships (costly, increases MTTA but reduces failure prob). - Implement monitoring via multiple indicators (recruitment stats, local interviews, radio call‑ins) to detect adverse trends early.

Cross‑vignette observations (synthesis)

- Automation reduces MTTA but increases detectability and risk of credibility failures. - Human‑in‑the‑loop hybrid operations trade speed for resilience. - Platform moderation and local institutional countermeasures are potent failure sources; the effects of industrialized influence hinge less on raw technical capability and more on sociotechnical embedding and credibility pathways.

## Core Hypotheses and Claims

H1: Higher levels of industrialization increase a state's capacity to wage sustained cognitive wars through expanded media and bureaucratic infrastructures.

H2: Industrialization changes form and tempo of cognitive influence, shifting from episodic propaganda to continuous shaping of cognitive ecologies.

H3: The effect of industrialization on cognitive wars is mediated by institutional arrangements (education systems, press regulation) and technology adoption curves.

H4: Non‑state actors exploit industrial infrastructures differently, producing asymmetries in cognitive war effectiveness across actors and contexts.

Falsifiable implications

- If H1 holds, cross‑national time‑series analyses should show positive correlation between industrial indicators (press circulation, bureaucratic capacity) and measured incidence/intensity of organized cognitive campaigns, conditional on political openness.
- If H3 holds, variation in outcomes should be explained by institutional moderators (e.g., media pluralism reduces effect size).


## Implications for Security Policy and Practice

Policy contention

- Defense and deterrence frameworks must incorporate industrial factors: infrastructure resilience (redundant, distributed communication channels), information production capacity (support for independent media), and statistical governance transparency (limits to mass profiling without safeguards).

Operational recommendations

1. Institutional robustness: invest in media pluralism, civic education and public literacy to raise friction and immunize audiences to rapid influence.
2. Transparency and audibility: require platform transparency for amplification algorithms and provenance tools for synthetic media to reduce credibility of malicious content.
3. Active defense: develop rapid detection/response teams combining technical signatures (botnet detection[^1]) with social remedies (trusted local messengers) and legal frameworks to sanction abusive industrialized influence campaigns.

Governance and norms

- Advocate international norms to constrain cross‑border industrialized influence (information sovereignty, limits on covert state‑backed cognitive operations), balanced against free expression concerns.


## Limits & Open Questions

This section documents operational assumptions, diagnostics, and open research questions. Human‑in‑the‑loop and adversarial behavior are treated as present assumptions informing models and delegation policies.

Key limitations

- Measurement challenges: many cognitive effects are latent and slow; direct measurement (belief change, policy influence) requires longitudinal designs and triangulation across surveys, behavior and passively observed engagement.
- Attribution uncertainty: distinguishing coordinated industrialized campaigns from organic viral events is nontrivial and relies on imperfect detection heuristics (coordination signals, bot fingerprints) that adversaries can evade.
- External validity: experimental persuasion results may not generalize across cultures, platform ecologies, or contested communications environments.

Operational Assumptions & Diagnostics (required subsection)

Assumption A — Bounded rationality of targets

- Model: Individuals use heuristics and limited sampling of information; beliefs update under noisy evidence and motivational biases.
- Diagnostic triggers: sudden shifts in engagement patterns among target cohorts, asymmetric diffusion of emotionally laden narratives, and increased reliance on peripheral cues (source salience over argument quality).
- Delegation policy: allow automated synthetic interventions (e.g., targeted counter‑messages) only when diagnostics indicate high peripheral cue reliance and when human validators confirm local context and cultural framing. In all cases require human oversight for synthetic content intended to alter durable belief states.

Assumption B — Adversarial communications model

- Model: Adversary optimizes content generation, timing and network placement subject to detection risk and logistic constraints; defender has partial observability and delayed response.
- Diagnostic triggers: coordinated, bot‑like burst patterns; rapid cross‑platform seeding of identical or slightly varied content; anomalies in source provenance metadata.
- Delegation policy: permit automated triage (flagging, temporary rate‑limiting) but require human adjudication before permanent takedown or public counter‑narrative deployment. Escalation thresholds: if false positive risk < 5% and immediate large‑scale harm probable (e.g., imminent violence), allow accelerated automated mitigation with post‑hoc human review.

Human‑in‑the‑loop and adversarial present assumptions

- Human judgment is central for decisions that trade credibility versus speed (the vignettes illustrate tradeoffs). Models and automated tools serve as force multipliers for detection and measurement but should not unilaterally deploy high‑impact synthetic content without human approval.
- Adversaries are adaptive: detection heuristics and platform policies produce strategic responses (e.g., using human proxies, decentralizing seeding). Defenses must assume ongoing adaptation and maintain monitoring and red‑teaming capabilities.

Open research questions

- What are robust empirical markers that distinguish industrialized cognitive campaigns from organic mass phenomena in low‑data settings? - How do different institutional mediators (education, press regulation, platform concentration) quantitatively modulate campaign success? - What are effective governance architectures that balance democratic openness and resilience to industrialized influence? - How can provenance and attribution be made robust against sophisticated forgeries without enabling censorship?

(Section ≥ 300 words.)


## Synthesis

This study links a structural cause—industrialization—to the rise and character of cognitive wars by mapping causal mechanisms from mass production and bureaucratic distribution to contemporary AI‑enabled content production and targeted amplification. The synthesis emphasizes three points:

1. Structural change matters: capacities created by industrialization (and renewed by digital platformization) determine not just whether influence is possible but its shape—tempo, scale, and persistence.
2. Socio‑technical embedding determines effectiveness: automated technical capabilities (generative models, bots) achieve strategic effects only when embedded within social institutions (trusted intermediaries, media ecosystems) or when they successfully simulate those institutions' trust signals.
3. Tradeoffs are central: speed and scale enabled by automation increase detectability and credibility risk; durable cognitive change usually requires slower, human‑mediated processes.

Taken together, the framework provides testable hypotheses and a practical policy orientation: build institutionally mediated resilience, focus detection on coordination and provenance, and privilege human oversight for high‑impact countermeasures.


## Conclusion and Future Research Agenda

Contributions

- The brief provides a theory‑first framework linking industrialization to cognitive warfare via explicit mechanisms and testable hypotheses.
- It operationalizes measurement strategies and proposes application‑level vignettes that highlight key tradeoffs and failure modes.

Future priorities

1. Data collection: build panel datasets linking industrial indicators and cognitive outcomes across historical and contemporary cases.
2. Method development: improve detection algorithms for coordinated industrialized influence while minimizing false positives; expand multimodal provenance tools for synthetic media detection[^3][^4][^7].
3. Policy experiments: pilot governance interventions (transparency mandates, civic education programs) with randomized rollout to measure resilience.
4. Adversarial testing: develop controlled CTF environments and red‑team exercises (e.g., CoSINT‑style platforms) to stress defenses and refine delegation policies[^13].

Closing note

Industrialization has long shaped how societies make meaning; AI and platform economies are the latest phase. Understanding cognitive wars requires integrating historical institutional analysis with contemporary technical methods, and doing so under explicit, falsifiable theoretical guidance.



## Assumptions Ledger

| Assumption | Rationale | Observable | Trigger | Fallback/Delegation | Scope |
|------------|-----------|------------|---------|---------------------|-------|
| Industrialization (mass production, routinized information systems, bureaucratic distribution and statistical governance) created structural capacities and vulnerabilities that enable cognitive wars. | Historical evidence shows mass media, bureaucracies and statistical governance enabled large-scale coordination, routinized message distribution, and centralized control over information flows; these are plausible prerequisites for organized influence at scale. | Presence and operationalization of mass communication infrastructures (legacy broadcast systems, large centralized media orgs, national-level data/registry systems), measurable throughput metrics (volume of content produced, distribution reach), and historical examples where those infrastructures were repurposed for propaganda or large-scale persuasion. | Detection of organized, large-scale influence activity that leverages national media or bureaucratic channels; proposal or discovery of campaigns that require mass-scale production/distribution; planning phases that reference centralized data or logistics. | If industrial infrastructures are absent or weak, restrict analysis to contexts where smaller-scale networked or grassroots mechanisms explain influence; delegate causal explanation to network effects, localized social contagion models, or direct interpersonal influence studies. | Applies to societies and political systems with developed mass media, bureaucratic record systems, and centralized distribution; less applicable to pre-industrial, highly decentralized, or offline-only societies. |
| AI-enabled content generation, personalization and automation materially lower costs, increase speed, and improve persistence of influence operations (the 'industrialization of influence'). | Recent advances in generative models (transformers, large language models), scalable automation, and programmatic microtargeting logically reduce per-item production cost, enable tailored messaging at scale, and permit high-frequency repetition—factors known to increase influence potency. | Surges in volume of stylistically similar or clearly synthetic content, detectable use of generative markers (repetition patterns, synthetic artifacts), logs or procurement records showing use of generative tools, measurable reductions in production time per message and increases in targeted impressions/ad frequency. | Deployment or procurement of large-scale generative tools by actors; observed sudden increases in personalized messaging volumes; platform detection of automated account bursts or coordinated generative campaigns. | If AI does not meaningfully reduce cost/scale, emphasize human-in-the-loop production plus amplification strategies (e.g., coordinated human farms, paid influencers), and delegate assessment of automation benefits to technical audits or controlled experiments. | Relevant where advanced generative AI and programmatic targeting are accessible to actors (state or non-state) and where platforms permit distribution; less applicable where AI access is restricted or distribution channels are tightly controlled. |
| Psychological mechanisms from social psychology and communication theory (attention scarcity, central vs peripheral persuasion routes, social proof) mediate whether and how influence campaigns translate into durable belief and decision changes. | Well‑established theories (e.g., Elaboration Likelihood Model, heuristics and biases, social proof) and extensive empirical literature show that message features, audience cognitive state and contextual cues determine depth and durability of persuasion. | Experimental or quasi-experimental evidence of differential belief change under manipulations of message elaboration, repeated exposure, personalization; attention and engagement metrics (time on content, eye-tracking, click-throughs) correlated with downstream belief or behavior measures; survey/time-series shifts coincident with exposure patterns. | Observed high engagement with campaign content accompanied by little durable opinion change, or conversely, small exposures producing large attitude shifts; commissioning of behavioral experiments or natural experiments to test mediation pathways. | If psychological mediation is weak or inconsistent, shift focus to short-term behavioral effects (e.g., mobilization, event attendance) or to institutional/structural mechanisms (policy levers, legal/organizational responses); delegate deeper psychological measurement to experimental collaborators. | Applies to populations with baseline capacity for media consumption and cognitive processing (literacy, attention bandwidth); effects vary by cultural context, polarization level, and individual differences—less predictive for populations under severe information deprivation or coercion. |
| Algorithmic amplification and platform network effects are necessary enablers for achieving strategic scale and persistence of cognitive campaigns in networked environments. | Attention is scarce; platform recommender systems and virality dynamics concentrate exposure. Without algorithmic amplification, expensive content production and microtargeting will have far lower reach and impact. | Strong correlation between recommendation/impression metrics and campaign reach; evidence that algorithmic boosts (trending, recommended posts) precede large spikes in engagement; detection of inauthentic amplification patterns (botnets, coordinated sharing) aligned with spikes in visibility. | Platform algorithm changes, policy enforcement actions, or observed drops in campaign reach; discovery of coordinated amplification behavior or rapid virality that would be unlikely without recommendation systems. | If campaigns succeed without algorithmic amplification, analyze organic memetic dynamics, offline mobilization channels, or cross-platform seeding strategies; delegate to social network analysts or ethnographers to explain non-algorithmic spread. | Pertinent in contexts dominated by commercial social platforms using recommendation algorithms; less applicable for influence in broadcast-only systems, closed messaging apps with no discoverability, or tightly controlled media ecosystems. |
| A theory-first, mixed-methods evidence strategy (anchored in canonical theory where direct peer-reviewed anchors are sparse) can generate falsifiable hypotheses linking macro industrial attributes to meso/micro cognitive outcomes. | Theory-first approaches provide causal primitives and guide measurement when direct longitudinal empirical traces are incomplete; mixed methods (historical, experimental, computational) allow triangulation and stronger inference across levels. | Production of clearly specified, testable hypotheses; availability of measurable mediators and outcomes across layers (e.g., entropy measures, attention time-series, experimental treatment effects); successful triangulation in pilot studies or case comparisons. | Data gaps, lack of peer-reviewed domain-specific literature, or inconsistent empirical findings that require theoretical synthesis to direct new data collection; grant or review requirements for falsifiability and methodological rigor. | If theory-first synthesis fails to produce testable hypotheses, narrow the project to descriptive case studies, formal models (simulation), or collaborate with domain specialists (experimental psychologists, platform data scientists) to operationalize measures. | Approach is appropriate for academic and policy research contexts where multiple data sources and disciplinary expertise are available; less suitable for rapid operational decision-making requiring immediate actionable intelligence without time for iterative theory development. |

## Claim-Evidence-Method (CEM) Grid

| Claim (C) | Evidence (E) | Method (M) | Status | Risk | TestID |
|-----------|--------------|------------|--------|------|--------|
| Primary: Industrialization (mass media + bureaucratic distribution + statistical governance) causally enabled "cognitive wars" by creating scalable infrastructures for production, targeting and distribution of symbolic content (i.e., industrialization → lowered cost & increased scale of influence ops). | [1] (social bots & scale), [5] (case: Indonesian social media campaigns), [13] (CoSINT: systems for studying misinformation at scale), [6] (deception & strategy of influence) | Mixed: comparative historical process tracing (archival + policy docs) to link industrial capacities to past influence campaigns; cross-sectional empirical analysis of contemporaneous platform/system capacities vs. observed campaign scale; system-level simulations that model production/distribution costs under industrial vs. pre‑industrial parameterizations. | E cited; M pending (historical process tracing & comparative sims planned) | If false, policy interventions focused on industrial infrastructure (platform regulation, supply-side controls) may miss the true drivers; resources could be misallocated to infrastructure fixes rather than behavioral, legal or diplomatic approaches. | T1 |
| Primary: Automation + generative models (transformer‑class LMs and image models) enable cheaper, faster, and more personalized persuasive content, increasing the feasible tempo and volume of cognitive interventions (i.e., automation amplifies production and personalization capacity). | [9] (BERT / transformer pretraining & capabilities), [10] (BEiT: image transformers enabling visual content generation/understanding), [12] (strategic argumentation frameworks for persuasion), [1] (bot-driven distribution amplifies generated content) | Validation via controlled generation experiments (produce messages with/without automated pipelines), A/B tests measuring production cost/time and automated quality metrics; lab and online experiments measuring persuasiveness of automated vs. human‑created messages; measurement work quantifying volume/velocity on platforms using automated detection pipelines. | E cited; M pending (generation experiments and platform measurement studies not yet completed) | If incorrect, emphasis on regulating generative AI or automating detection may be overstated; defensive investments (e.g., watermarking, content provenance) could be prioritized incorrectly. | T2 |
| Primary: Amplification networks (botnets, coordinated accounts) produce artificial salience and false consensus effects that can shift attention and catalyze mobilization or demoralization even when original content is low‑credibility. | [1] (Rise of Social Bots shows bot behaviors & amplification), [7] (propaganda techniques in memes demonstrating affective/motivational leverage), [8] (modeling metastable political duopoly & emotional asymmetries demonstrating system-level shifts from asymmetric influence). | Network intervention simulations (inject synthetic bots into empirical or synthetic networks and measure attention/consensus outcomes); field and online experiments (seeding content with controlled amplification); time-series analysis linking amplification events to downstream measures (search trends, protest mobilization, polls). | E cited; M pending (simulation runs and experimental field tests planned) | If wrong, countermeasures aimed at takedowns or bot suppression could have limited impact on real-world mobilization, and attribution/mitigation strategies may be misdirected. | T3 |
| Secondary: High‑fidelity synthetic media (deepfakes, reenactment) materially increases the plausibility and perceived credibility of deceptive narratives, raising uncertainty and accelerating narrative adoption where verification is slow. | [4] (Face2Face: real-time face capture/reenactment), [3] (role of visual content in fake news detection), [7] (memes & multimodal propaganda techniques). | Laboratory experiments exposing participants to matched claims presented as (a) authentic video, (b) deepfake video, (c) text-only, measuring belief update and confidence; evaluation of forensic detection tools on operationally relevant deepfakes; event studies of incidents where deepfakes were used and downstream belief/behavioral impacts. | E cited; M pending (lab experiments + detection benchmarks planned) | If false, heavy investment in detection/provenance for visual media may have lower marginal returns than anticipated and could divert resources from addressing textual/algorithmic personalization risks. | T4 |
| Secondary: Microtargeting + message‑frame matching increases immediate compliance or behavior change for receptive audiences but produces heterogeneous durability depending on cognitive route (central vs. peripheral) — i.e., personalization improves short‑term effectiveness but not uniformly long‑term belief change. | [12] (strategic argumentation & modeling persuadee beliefs), [11] (limits of sentiment models vis‑à‑vis psychological states), [5] (empirical campaign-level evidence of targeted messaging tactics). | Randomized controlled trials that vary message tailoring intensity and measure short-term behavior vs. longer-term belief persistence (panel surveys); mediation analysis testing ELM-like moderators (motivation/ability); simulation integrating micro-level persuasion dynamics into population-level models. | E cited; M pending (RCTs & longitudinal panels not yet executed) | If false, assumptions about tailoring as a scalable leverage point for influence ops would be flawed; policies regulating microtargeting may under- or over-estimate their public‑safety benefit. | T5 |
| Secondary: Institutional and platform design features (recommender systems, feedback loops, content moderation norms) create feedback and metastability in attention ecosystems, enabling small interventions to produce outsized systemic shifts (attention as scarce channel with feedback-driven amplification). | [2] (multidimensional social recommender structures), [13] (CoSINT: experimental infrastructures to study misinformation), [1] (bot ecosystems interacting with recommendation/amplification dynamics). | System-identification and control‑theory style modeling of platform feedback (estimate transfer functions from exogenous shocks to attention metrics); online platform experiments toggling recommender parameters; agent‑based simulations coupling recommender dynamics with user attention and belief update rules. | E cited; M pending (platform experiments and model identification work planned) | If false, remedies focused on recommender adjustment or system-level feedback dampening may be less effective than simpler content moderation or user‑education approaches. | T6 |
