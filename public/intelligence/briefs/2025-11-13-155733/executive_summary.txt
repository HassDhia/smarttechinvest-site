Recent Comm‑MADRL survey formalizes communication in multi-agent RL, proposing nine analytic dimensions and three targeting modes—broadcast, group-targeted, and constraint‑conditioned—creating a practical taxonomy that translates research into production requirements. Critical findings: modular architectures separating perception, policy and communication; attention-based routing to avoid quadratic costs; and distinct infrastructure needs for each targeting mode. Implications for operators: treat inter-agent comms as a first‑class concern—deploy SDN/multicast-capable fabrics, communication-aware schedulers, smart NIC/DPU offloads, standardized message schemas, observability for reward‑per‑byte metrics, and robust authentication and rate‑limits to mitigate spoofing and DoS. For investors: expect capital flow into middleware SDKs, observability/simulation tooling, and low‑latency edge and NIC/DPU hardware; prioritize firms embodying the nine dimensions, proprietary interaction datasets, or platformized SDKs. For business development: wedge with a communication primitives SDK exposing broadcast, group, and conditional channels; run vertical pilots demonstrating TCO and reward‑per‑byte gains; combine open reference implementations with premium managed services. Recommended actions: integrate the nine dimensions into product roadmaps, add comms-aware placement and telemetry, pursue hyperscaler and NIC partnerships, and establish standards/benchmarks to lock in customers and accelerate adoption. Also prioritize simulation-based CI, cryptographic provenance in message formats, versioned schemas, and measurable KPIs (latency, bandwidth, reward-per-byte) to guide deployments, and align SLAs to communication-cost tradeoffs. now.
