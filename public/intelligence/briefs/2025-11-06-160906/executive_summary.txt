Recent cross-domain research reveals persistent machine‑learning detection blind spots and operational fragmentation that create clear market and operational priorities. A five‑year review shows state‑of‑the‑art classifiers fail to detect already‑compromised databases via SQL injection and under-detect drive‑by downloads, producing a premium for vendors with validated datasets, retroactive DB forensics, and edge/browser detectors. A national survey of 18 pediatric tertiary centers exposes wide variability in massive hemorrhage protocols, signaling demand for a centralized activation repository and benchmarking dashboard. Operators must deploy DB‑integrity validators, retroactive anomaly scoring, edge NPUs for streaming detection, and hardened consensus/ADMM stacks with Byzantine‑resilience; adopt federated learning, standardized schemas, and playbooks for post‑compromise triage. Investors should favor firms owning labeled compromised‑DB datasets, specialized ML teams, and platform plays for pediatric MHP repositories and ADMM middleware, as these assets confer pricing power and acquisition appeal. BD should prioritize three wedges: post‑compromise SQLi forensics, endpoint drive‑by detectors, and a SaaS pediatric MHP repository; pursue academic and cloud partnerships, pilot-to-contract GTM, and outcome‑based pricing. Immediate actions: fund targeted ML R&D, build federated incident repositories and audit dashboards, and run red‑team forensic exercises to validate coverage and reduce integration risk. Measure outcomes, publish benchmarks, secure clinical approvals, and iterate rapidly on deployments continuously.
