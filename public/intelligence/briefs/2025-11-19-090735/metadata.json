  "executive_summary": "Run parade-synced flagship activations and short co‑branded pop-ups to convert Thanksgiving morning viewers into same‑day shoppers and shift volume into the pre‑Black Friday window [^2][^1]. Pilot activity of this type shows same‑day foot traffic up about 12–18% versus baseline during the broadcast window [^2][^5]. Early gift‑guide campaigns and staggered promotions are moving share forward; expect early‑deal share to be roughly 15–25% higher than last year in key metros [^3][^9]. Collaboration teams must, within 30 days, lock partners and creative, set inventory and fixed pricing for limited capsules/pop‑ups, and instrument live measurement (control stores, traffic counters, minute‑level POS) to capture and compare uplift [^1][^4]. [^1][^3]",

    "Deploy mid-November gift guides and a staggered promotion calendar (6 weeks, 10–15% shallow promos) and compare conversion and AOV against prior-year timing."
