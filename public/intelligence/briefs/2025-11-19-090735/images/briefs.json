  "hero": "Cinematic dark scene: a low-angle, moody studio-shot of an operator and a studio producer leaning over a matte-brushed stopwatch/countdown device on a concrete table, heavy negative space and rim lighting framing their silhouettes. A distant parade-broadcast glow and faint confetti bokeh imply a Thanksgiving morning activation and time-boxed campaign while fingers hover above the ticking device, the countdown casting warm amber reflections. Composition cues: three-quarter crop, shallow depth of field, materials called out—brushed metal stopwatch, matte leather gloves, fogged glass partition—no literal UI or on-image text.",
  "hero_alt": "Low-angle dark studio scene showing two collaborators leaning over a brushed-metal stopwatch/countdown on a concrete table; warm countdown light and distant parade glow illuminate their hands and silhouettes, surrounded by deep negative space.",
  "signal_map": "Abstract data vignette: an overhead oblique composition of six concentric glass rings (each ring corresponding to signals S1–S6) etched with fine radial micro-patterns, softly backlit and converging toward a single warm aperture — the glowing \"YES window\" at center. Composition cues: top-down angle, mixed materials (tempered glass, brushed aluminum, matte black foam), heavy vignette and negative space to imply attribution and campaign convergence without literal charts or text.",
  "signal_map_alt": "Overhead oblique view of six backlit concentric glass rings converging into a warm central aperture labeled conceptually as the YES window; rings look like layered glass and brushed metal, set in deep shadow.",
  "case_studies": [
    "Dusk street-level wide-angle of a flagship retail window: rain-slick pavement reflections, marquee glow, and a silhouetted co-branded pop-up inset visible through the glass; inside on a lacquered counter a family bundle (small electronics paired with an accessory) sits staged while an operator adjusts studio lighting from outside. Composition cues: wide-angle, low-contrast dusk palette, materials include polished wood counter, backlit fabric pop-up, tempered glass window; negative space and moody tungsten highlights, no text or UI.",
    "Dusk close three-quarter angle on a flagship storefront display: a pop-up capsule inset to the right shows limited-edition luxury pieces on matte pedestals, with a bundled boxed offer placed on a velvet-covered counter as studio and operator hands make final adjustments. Composition cues: tight crop, warm tungsten rim light, materials—velvet, brushed brass, matte black pedestals—strong negative space and cinematic shadows; show pop-up inset and family-bundle placement without any on-image text."
