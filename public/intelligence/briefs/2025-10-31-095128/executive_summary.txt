Recent pilots — PLA evaluation of Deepseek, China’s low-cost drone swarm trials, Sweden’s Saab tests, Mastercard’s agentic-commerce push and Bloomberg/FT distribution initiatives — indicate pricing and capital concentration around AI/control layers, secure communications, edge compute and platformed information services. Operationally, militaries and operators must shift from hardware-centric procurement to software-first lifecycle practices: deploy MLOps, secure device identity and OTA updates, standardized telemetry, adversarial testing and human-in-the-loop fail-safes. Investors should favor software-led defense integrators, cloud and chip providers, and payment-network incumbents enabling embedded agentic commerce while de-emphasizing commoditized airframe manufacturers. Business development should pursue modular, certified stacks (perception models, mesh middleware, attestation), pilot-first GTM, chip and cloud partnerships, and tiered pricing with managed services to convert trials into recurring ARR. Immediate recommended actions: accelerate model validation pipelines, fund mesh/edge comms and secure CI/CD for firmware and models, negotiate pilot-to-contract clauses, and productize curated low-latency feeds for enterprise workflows. Risks include adversarial attacks, export controls, regulatory scrutiny and procurement delays; mitigate via red-teaming, compliance tooling and diversified partner channels. Focus investments and BD efforts on interoperable, service-led offerings that lock in customers through integration, continual model refreshes and SLAs. Act now: prioritize pilots, certification, and contractual options to secure first-mover advantage now.
