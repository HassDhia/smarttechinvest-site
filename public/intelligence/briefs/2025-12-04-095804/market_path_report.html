<h1>Shift early holiday demand without deeper discounts</h1>
<p><em>Move spend and creative into a two-week partner-led window to lift visits and learn fast</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can chase <strong>10-15%</strong> more visits in the Nov 20 - Dec 04 window, protect margin with partner funding, and validate learnings if you greenlight a two-week flagship pilot—approve the spend plan and partner mechanics.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What we are seeing</h2>
<p>A clear, repeated signal: customers tune out volume when messages are generic, but respond when an offer feels earned through a partner or a tailored creative. That pattern means a sitewide 20% cut attracts attention but teaches us little and erodes margin. For P&amp;L and stores the risk is blunt: higher short-term sales at the cost of worse data and thinner margin. We need a way to reallocate the same or less spend into actions that raise visits and surface who is worth courting later.</p>
<h2>The move</h2>
<p>If you want earlier holiday buyers without deeper discounts, run the two-week flagship pilot that pairs three cohort-targeted sends, partner-funded co-promos, and in-store QR activations. Treat the generic 20% off as the control and run the pilot in the Nov 20 - Dec 04, 2025 window so measurement is clean against the same holiday baseline. Keep creative tight, coordinate partner placements to borrow reach, and staff the store for brief bursts of redemptions. This is the collab-led holiday approach because it lowers acquisition cost while keeping margin intact.</p>
<h2>Size of prize</h2>
<p>Hitting the target feels like a steady line of extra customers through the flagship doors rather than a single chaotic spike: <strong>10-15%</strong> more visits means fuller morning and early-evening shifts and more predictable conversion for associates. Shifting early-window share from current levels toward <strong>20-30%</strong> moves holiday revenue earlier, easing inventory pressure and increasing higher-margin transactions. If partner mechanics work and CPA stays low, these are repeatable moves you can scale into other flagships or markets.</p>
<h2>Risks</h2>
<p>What breaks first is marginalization of partner value: if partners push broad deals that cannibalize full-price sales, margin collapses before we learn. Measurement can also be confounded if simultaneous broad blasts run; we will watch cohort-level conversion and event CPA to detect bleed. The safe stop is immediate: pause partner placements or cohort sends if event CPA rises above the ceiling or QR redemption falls below the validation floor.</p>
<h2>Decision requested</h2>
<p>I want to run one disciplined early-holiday pilot in a flagship during Nov 20 - Dec 04, 2025 to test partner-funded co-promos, three cohort creatives, and in-store QR activations against the sitewide 20% control. Headcount, partnerships, and finance need clear triggers: Retail will staff and measure footfall and QR daily; Marketing will run cohort sends and pause any broad blasts that spike unsubscribe or CPA; Partnerships must sign activation windows this week and Finance must approve the conditional spend. Approve the two-week flagship pilot with partner-funded co-promos and three-cohort precision sends starting Nov 20 - Dec 04, 2025.</p>
<h3>Why this window matters</h3>
<ul>
<li>Holiday buying is pulling earlier; testing the early window now gives first-mover learning before the peak.</li>
<li>Partner-funded placements lower acquisition cost now, preserving margin while letting us buy reach we would otherwise pay for.</li>
<li>Short, staffed events convert visits into measurable redemptions quickly, so we learn which cohorts are worth scaling.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Targets for this pilot</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lift store visits <strong>10-15%</strong> vs baseline during the Nov 20 - Dec 04, 2025 two-week window.</li>
<li>Increase early-window buyer share to <strong>20-30%</strong> of total holiday buyers within the Nov 20 - Dec 04, 2025 window.</li>
<li>Keep event CPA at or below <strong>0.8x</strong> baseline during the Nov 20 - Dec 04, 2025 test window.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Decision requested</h3>
<p>Approve the two-week flagship pilot with partner-funded co-promos and three-cohort precision sends starting Nov 20 - Dec 04, 2025.</p>
<p><em>Forward with subject: Approve two-week Nov 20 - Dec 04 flagship pilot: partner co-promos + cohort sends</em></p>
