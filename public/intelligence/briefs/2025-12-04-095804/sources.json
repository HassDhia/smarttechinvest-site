Desert Hills Premium Outlets stands as a retail oasis in Cabazon, where designer labels and budget-friendly prices coexist in a relationship that feels almost too good to be true. The multi-level parking structure welcomes bargain hunters with the promise of designer treasures within. Those palm trees aren’t just for show—they’re shade for your victory march back to the car. Photo credit: Carlson Cheng There’s an undeniable thrill in walking away from a Valentino store with a purchase and still having enough cash left for a decent lunch. This sprawling collection of high-end bargains sits conveniently off Interstate 10, just a short drive from Palm Springs, luring both dedicated shopaholic road-trippers and casual browsers with its siren call of slashed price tags. You might be familiar with those depressing outlet centers that feel like fashion purgatory – where last season’s mistakes go to be forgotten? This isn’t remotely that experience. Desert Hills represents the pinnacle of the Premium Outlets collection, where prestigious brands send legitimate merchandise that you’d actually want to own, just with more palatable pricing. The visual appeal alone warrants appreciation – sandy-hued buildings with terracotta roofs, breezy walkways, and strategically placed palm trees creating welcome shade from the relentless desert heat. Lacoste and Armani face off across a sun-drenched plaza. It’s like the United Nations of retail therapy, but with better lighting. Photo credit: 王師（師哥） It’s as if a luxury shopping district and your financial advisor had a beautiful baby. Step through the entrance and you’re immediately surrounded by fashion’s most prestigious names. Gucci, Prada, Saint Laurent, Fendi – brands that typically cause credit limit anxiety – all conveniently gathered and surprisingly accessible to non-celebrities. The complex unfolds across an impressive campus divided into two main areas connected by an elegant underpass, housing an almost overwhelming 180+ stores. That’s not a typo – more than 180 stores of discounted designer temptation await your exploration. The East Village generally contains the ultra-premium luxury boutiques, while the West Village features a blend of high-end and more moderately priced options. At Marni, even the shoes are having a colorful party. This display could convince anyone that neon yellow footwear is a wardrobe essential. Photo credit: Cash Pro tip: sensible footwear is non-negotiable here. This isn’t a casual browsing experience – it’s a strategic retail expedition that rewards stamina with armfuls of shopping bags. Approaching Desert Hills without a game plan is a rookie error comparable to tackling an all-you-can-eat buffet after a large meal. Start by checking their official website before visiting to identify any special promotions or seasonal sales. Many retailers offer additional discounts through their loyalty programs, and the center occasionally runs property-wide events that can multiply your savings significantly. Timing matters enormously in the outlet shopping universe. Marc Jacobs bags lined up like beauty contestants on glass shelves. Each one silently whispering, “Take me home, I’m 60% of",

The Optimove Insights 2025 Marketing Fatigue Report for Black Friday/Cyber Monday , based on a survey of 1,034 consumers ahead of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, finds that 56% of shoppers are only bothered by message volume when the content is irrelevant . When messages are personalized and timely, consumers welcome frequent communication. The report identifies six patterns that differentiate high-performing holiday campaigns from those that contribute to fatigue and finds that brands using Positionless Marketing , Optimove’s AI- and tech-powered approach, enables marketers to operate independently across data, creative, and optimization, consistently outperform across all six. Key findings include: Irrelevance drives fatigue , not message volume: 56% of consumers say frequent messages don’t bother them if the content is relevant to their interests. Early outreach works , when personalized: 72% of shoppers say early Black Friday/Cyber Monday campaigns increase likelihood to purchase, but untargeted early blasts underperform. Price matters, but relevance differentiates: While 50% choose the best discount, 21% prioritize personalization, timing, and convenience. Email fatigue is about channel over-reliance: 55% of consumers identify email as the most overwhelming channel; multi-channel campaigns create significantly less fatigue. Exclusivity beats urgency: 53% engage most with loyalty/VIP messages; only 24% favor “limited time” urgency-based campaigns. Holiday spending remains strong: 46% plan to spend more than last year; personalized recommendations drive confidence and wallet share. “Consumers are underwhelmed when overwhelmed by irrelevant messages, ” sa id Optimove CEO ,",

Every December, grocery aisles and online carts transform into test markets disguised as celebrations. Shelves fill with limited-edition packaging, seasonal flavors, and giftable product bundles all designed not only to capture holiday excitement but to generate priceless data. For consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies, the holidays are no longer just the biggest sales moment of the year; they are a strategic laboratory for innovation, experimentation, and brand reinvention. The Holidays as a Controlled Experiment In a world of endless product options, consumer loyalty has become fragile. The holiday season gives CPG firms a unique chance to reset the narrative and reengage shoppers who might otherwise scroll past their offerings. What makes this window so powerful is that consumers are unusually open to novelty. They expect to change new flavors, fresh packaging, and creative bundles and are emotionally primed to buy. Behind the festive wrapping, however, lies a disciplined system of market testing. Seasonal products offer a low-risk, high-reward way to test innovation hypotheses. A beverage company might release a spiced winter edition to measure demand for bold flavors. A skincare line may launch a small-batch holiday scent to test consumer sensitivity to pricing or texture. The results of these limited runs often decide which ideas graduate to the core product line in the following year. Agile Innovation at Scale What was once a 12-month product cycle has shrunk to weeks. The holiday season has accelerated innovation timelines across the CPG world. Many companies now rely on agile development models borrowed from technology firms: small cross-functional teams, iterative testing, and rapid feedback loops. A well-known snack producer, for example, recently tested a new texture variation by releasing it as a “holiday treat.” Within two weeks, social media engagement, e-commerce reviews, and retailer sell-through data were analyzed to determine whether it could become a permanent offering. The speed of that loop would have been unthinkable even a decade ago, when research panels and focus groups dominated product development. This agility is driven by data. Online sales channels now give companies instant access to consumer behavior, including what people click, abandon, and reorder. The holidays amplify those signals, producing dense, time-bound insights that can guide decisions long after the decorations are gone. Limited Editions as Data Collection Scarcity drives urgency, and in the CPG world, that urgency becomes a gold mine of behavioral information. Limited-edition runs let brands observe how consumers respond to novelty and price elasticity without risking brand dilution. For example, a major coffee company introduced a holiday blend for a six-week period, knowing it would sell out quickly. The real purpose wasn’t just to drive sales; it was to test consumer reaction to a new sourcing region and flavor profile. When the product exceeded expectations, the company quietly incorporated elements of that flavor into its permanent offerings the following year. Similarly, a large personal care firm tested biodegradable packaging under the guise of a holiday sustainability campaign. The short window helped the company collect real usage and disposal data without committing to a full supply chain change. The findings later guided a company-wide packaging redesign. The",

Black Friday and Cyber Monday aren’t just high-volume days. They expose the strengths and weaknesses of every system a retailer relies on. When traffic spikes and customer behavior shifts hour by hour, you see very quickly whether your data foundation is built to keep up or if it starts to crack under load. One area feeling the most strain is retail media networks (RMNs). RMNs have grown into a major revenue engine for retailers , but the underlying data needed to power them hasn’t kept pace. As budgets rise, the bar for performance and transparency rises with them. RMNs Are Expanding, But Their Data Foundations Aren’t This holiday season brings more volatility than usual. Shoppers are watching their budgets closely , retailers are investing heavily in artificial intelligence, and every decision needs to be backed by data that's both complete and trustworthy. The challenge is that many retailers are still operating on fragmented or incomplete customer data. More than half say their customer records are scattered across systems, which makes consistent identity resolution difficult. AI can’t fix this. It can only work with the inputs it’s given, and when the identity layer is unstable, the outputs are too. RMNs depend on a clean, unified identity to build audiences, personalize in real time, and measure conversions. Without it, retailers end up with mismatched audiences, inconsistent targeting, and campaign results that take days to piece together — if they can be stitched together at all. Third-Party Identity is Ending, and the Timing Couldn’t Be Worse Historically, RMNs leaned on third-party systems to match audiences between retailers and advertisers. That world is fading fast. Cookies are disappearing, regulations are tightening, and delays introduced by external match partners now create real risk. A 48-hour attribution delay during peak holiday traffic isn’t a minor inconvenience. It can mean losing the window where shoppers are most likely to buy. It also creates blind spots that make it nearly impossible to optimize campaigns in-flight. The only sustainable path forward is a first-party data foundation that gives retailers a reliable representation of each customer across channels, from in-store purchases to loyalty interactions to online behaviors. Turning Holiday Signals Into Year-Round Advantage Black Friday and Cyber Monday generate more signal density than any other period on the retail calendar. For RMNs, this isn’t just a sales moment. It's the clearest look at customer behavior you’ll get all year. The most advanced retailers treat these days as customer data events. They want to know: Which audiences converted and why? Which products and promotions drove repeat behavior? Which customers came back aft",

Whether you increase spend or not, success and increased conversions during this period are about planning smarter and testing earlier. Adjust’s 2025 Shopping App Insights report found that installs for shopping apps grew 104 percent year-over-year in Q4 2024, with sessions up 42 percent. Meanwhile, marketplace apps saw the strongest user engagement metrics, accounting for 60 percent of global sessions. These apps maintained the best day one retention rate at 24.8 percent, significantly outperforming the global overall e-commerce average of 13 percent. The takeaway is clear: An increasing number of shoppers are turning to mobile apps during this peak shopping season. For mobile marketers and app teams, the initial conversion is critical, but implementing strategic measures to retain the highest possible number of new users will pay off later. Instead of focusing solely on volume, if even a percentage from the rush period can be retained, that's a big win. Plan Early, Prepare for a Marathon Many brands still see Q4 as a sprint between Black Friday and Christmas. In reality, data shows holiday shopping starting earlier than ever as consumers are on an almost constant search for deals, which ramps up the closer we get to Q4. A Bankrate survey , for example, finds nearly half of shoppers planned to start holiday shopping before Halloween this year. Treating Q4 as a marathon that starts before the quarter begins, rather than a week-to-week sprint, ensures you don’t miss weeks of sustained, high-value traffic. Q4 ad costs can accelerate fast. In Q1 2025, global shopping app CPIs (cost per install) surpassed $1 globally. During the peak weeks like those in Q4, that number can go even higher. Waiting to experiment with creatives or channels until Q4 means optimizing under pressure — and at the highest prices. Instead, test before the rush: Explore New Channels: Connected TV (CTV), influencer partnerships and augmented reality experiences can differentiate your brand in social feeds overflowing with ads. Refine Your Funnel: Identify the highest-performing touchpoints before costs spike. Diversify Acquisition Sources: Avoid overreliance on one ad network. A diversified mix cushions performance when a single source slows. Stay Flexible: Monitor pacing and reallocate spend where performance is strongest. Agility keeps budgets efficient. The brands that enter Q4 with tested, data-backed playbooks can scale confidently, while competitors scramble to adjust midseason. Make the Path to Purchase Seamless Once you’ve captured their attention, the next challenge is keeping users on the path to purchase. In Q4, sho",
