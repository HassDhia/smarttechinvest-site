  "executive_summary": "You need to grow early-holiday sales and learn faster without collapsing margin or blasting customers with more irrelevant noise during the Nov 20 – Dec 04 window. This matters because the plan must drive **10–15%** foot-traffic uplift (stretch **≥25%**), lift early-window share from **12–15%** toward **20–30%**, keep event CPA ≤ **0.80× baseline**, and achieve QR redemptions of **≥5%** of footfall to validate learnings [^3][^8]. Favor a collab-led holiday approach: run partner-funded, co-branded micro-events and three cohort-targeted creatives instead of a blanket sitewide cut, and within 30 days Partnerships, CRM, and Stores must launch two co-branded events, instrument cohort-level conversion, event CPA and QR redemption, and treat the generic 20% off as the control to measure success [^3].",

    "Stand up two partner-funded, co-branded micro-events in the Nov 20–Dec 04 window and assign paid-reach commitments from each partner.",

    "Instrument cohort-level conversion, event CPA, unsubscribe rate, and QR redemptions tied to footfall and report daily to Marketing and Stores for rapid iteration."
