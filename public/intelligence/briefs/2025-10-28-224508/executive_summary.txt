Agentic AI is shifting discovery into instant action: large distribution (ChatGPT's hundreds of millions weekly) coupled with payment rails (PayPal adopting ACP) enables in-AI checkout and concentrated pricing power. Vertical agentic deployments show measurable ROI — Assort Health's >40M interactions with 98% resolution and 94%+ PSAT, and AEC permitting platforms delivering multi-million USD savings — proving rapid payback. Developer infra (Shuttle's NL provisioning) turns intent into programmatic infra actions, accelerating adoption and lowering friction. Implications: Operators must implement durable session state, idempotent APIs, provenance tagging, and hybrid model routing to secure payments, EHR access, and provisioning; prioritize audit backplanes, sandboxed tool registries, and compensating transactions. Investors should favor platform plays that own checkout/catalog surfaces, vertical SaaS with demonstrable ROI, and infra enabling safe agent actions (compute, cloud, security). BD should prioritize ACP onboarding bundles, EHR and permitting connector offers, and partnerships with distribution owners and payment rails. Recommended actions: run short ROI pilots (4–8 weeks), instrument business SLOs, adopt performance-based pricing where possible, harden prompt-injection defenses, and build modular ACP and compliance packages to accelerate adoption and M&A optionality. Prioritize measurable pilots, partner with payment platforms, and prepare for rapid consolidation while investing in security, compliance, and developer tooling now.
