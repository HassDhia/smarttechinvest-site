Recent research introduces a generalized interaction variable that represents instantaneous real power (W) and generalized reactive power (VAR) as a formal interlayer interface, and demonstrates its use in a multi‑layer distributed output‑feedback architecture with intermediate VAR commands implemented via Feedback Linearizing Control (FBLC) or Sliding Mode Control (SMC). Validation on a controllable RLC element shows physical plausibility; complementary work provides quaternion‑based, singularity‑free attitude control for thrust‑vectoring multirotors, reducing estimator complexity. Implications: operators must adopt VAR‑centric runbooks, deterministic edge compute, time‑synchronized networking, topology‑aware observers, and formal verification to secure stable distributed operation and fast islanding. Investors should prioritize software+hardware firms that bridge theory to deployable stacks—edge control middleware, VAR‑capable inverters, real‑time SoCs, and certified UAV controllers—while hedging regulatory, certification, supply‑chain, and cyber risks. Business development opportunities favor modular productization: VAR‑Command middleware, certified edge controllers validated on RLC testbeds, and quaternion flight modules with certification artifacts. Recommended actions: (1) run pilots integrating interaction‑variable APIs with FBLC/SMC controllers and RLC analogs; (2) invest in deterministic edge hardware and TSN/PTP networking; (3) require formal stability proofs and third‑party audits in procurement; (4) pursue OEM embed partnerships and revenue‑share pilots to accelerate adoption. These steps convert control IP into measurable operational and tangible commercial value.
