# Command Theory for Multi-Agent Systems: A Theory-First Brief

## Title and Abstract

Title: Command Theory for Multi-Agent Systems — Formal primitives, hybrid C2 synthesis, and operational diagnostics

Abstract: This brief develops a theory-first framework distinguishing "command" (intent and directives) from "control" (mechanisms implementing behavior) in multi-agent systems. We present formal primitives (agents, decision nodes, information channels, objectives), define hierarchical and distributed control, and prove conditions for decentralizability and communication lower bounds. We synthesize hybrid command-and-control (C2) architectures, propose verification and simulation methods, and give parametrized application vignettes (disaster response; contested-spectrum ISR swarms) with metrics (mean time to adapt, failure probability) and failure-mode analysis. We close with operational assumptions, diagnostics, and delegation policies that make human-in-loop and adversarial communications explicit system-level constraints. Anchor references are selected to ground control-theoretic and multi-agent consensus arguments in peer-reviewed literature [^2][^3][^6].

# Executive Summary

## Title and Abstract
> **Disclosure & Method Note.** This is a *theory-first* brief. Claims are mapped to evidence using a CEM grid; quantitative effects marked **Illustrative Target** will be validated via the evaluation plan. **Anchor Status:** Anchored.



## Introduction and Motivation

Claims and framing

- Command and control are distinct: "command" denotes intent, constraints, and authority structure; "control" denotes the dynamical and algorithmic mechanisms that realize behavior toward objectives. This separation enables precise reasoning about what can be delegated and verified.
- A theory-first approach clarifies assumptions and yields transferable principles across military, emergency response, robotics, and infrastructure domains.
- Existing C2 literature often conflates hierarchical authority with effective control; formal separation allows trade-off analysis between latency, robustness, and optimality.

Rationale: a compact formalism that separates intent from execution reduces category errors (e.g., assuming authority implies observability) and supports mechanized synthesis of coordination protocols.


## Foundations

Why these anchors?

We anchor the theoretical and technical claims on peer-reviewed, non-preprint work to ensure that core mathematical and control-theoretic building blocks have been vetted. The selected anchors cover (1) established consensus and networked control theory applicable to distributed agents [^3], (2) formal architectures and holonic perspectives on command-and-control synthesis in engineered systems [^2], and (3) robustness and adversary-aware local-information consensus results relevant to contested environments [^6]. These sources were chosen because they (a) provide canonical theorems used in decentralization proofs, (b) present architectures compatible with C2 hybridization, and (c) explicitly treat adversarial and local-information constraints required for operational diagnostics. Using peer-reviewed anchors reduces the risk of basing synthesis or verification methods on unvetted heuristics; where literature gaps exist we note them explicitly and treat supplementary material as provisional.

Caveat: the brief complements these anchors with formal propositions and models that synthesize their insights into a unified C2 formalism; those synthesized results are presented here with explicit assumptions to keep provenance clear.


## Theory-First Framework and Research Questions

Framework overview

- Primitives: agents (A_i), decision nodes (D_j), objectives (J), information channels (C_{ij}), authority relations (≻), time scales (τ_command ≫ τ_control).
- Composition: architectures are compositions of primitives; command is an operator that constrains the feasible control policy space for subsets of agents.

Research questions

1. When can hierarchical and distributed architectures be transformed into one another without loss of guarantees (decentralizability)?
2. What information structures permit stable coordination and what summary statistics suffice for decentralization?
3. What are fundamental trade-offs among scalability, robustness, and optimality across mixed C2 designs?

Goals: derive necessary/sufficient conditions for decentralized realization of hierarchical commands, quantify communication lower bounds for consensus under adversarial models, and generate design rules for hybrid C2.


## Formal Definitions and Notation

- Agent: A_i with state x_i(t) ∈ X_i, action u_i(t) ∈ U_i, observation y_i(t) = h_i(x, t) restricted by sensing topology S.
- Control policy: π_i : H_i → U_i mapping local history H_i to actions. A centralized controller is π_C : H_global → U_all.
- Command: a high-level directive κ that constrains allowable π_i via constraint set K(κ) ⊂ Π (policy space). Commands specify objectives J_κ and authority scope S_κ (which agents they apply to).
- Hierarchical control: a partial-order of decision layers L_1 ≻ L_2 ≻ ... where higher layers issue commands κ_l that constrain lower-layer policy sets K(κ_l).
- Distributed control: policies π_i implemented locally with peer-to-peer communication defined by graph G = (V,E) and information channels C_{ij} with delays δ_{ij} and capacity bounds b_{ij}.
- Information partition: σ = {σ_i} where σ_i is the sigma-algebra of events observable to agent i; sufficiency of σ for decentralization will be formalized.

Notation: time indexed by discrete t or continuous t, probabilistic statements in P[·], expectation E[·].


## Hierarchical Control: Structures and Properties

Structure

Hierarchical architectures are trees or layered graphs where nodes at layer l issue constraints κ_{l→m} to nodes at lower layers. Authority defines permissible overrides and overrides are resolved by authority precedence.

Properties

- Clear responsibility allocation simplifies strategic planning and formal verification of high-level objectives.
- Latency amplification: commands traverse top-down cycles (τ_cmd) and bottom-up feedback (τ_fb); the effective closed-loop response depends on τ_cmd + τ_fb.
- Single-point-of-failure (SPOF) and model-mismatch brittleness: if a higher-level model is incorrect, constrained lower layers can systematically err.

Guarantees under idealized assumptions

If full observability and negligible communication delay hold, hierarchical decomposition can provide modular correctness by divide-and-conquer proofs: each subtask can be verified in isolation under the assumption that higher-layer constraints are correct.


## Distributed Control in Multi-Agent Systems

Advantages and limits

- Distributed control localizes authority, improving resilience to single-node failures and scaling better with agent count.
- Fundamental limits: partial information and asynchronous communication introduce impossibility/complexity lower bounds (e.g., consensus time scales with diameter and with adversarial fault rate) [^3][^6].

Emergence and incentives

- Simple local rules can produce coordinated global behavior when information topology and incentives align, but global optimality is generally unattainable without additional structure (e.g., sufficiency of local summaries or common objectives).


## Command and Control (C2) Systems: Synthesis

Hybridization principle

C2 architectures are naturally hybrid: strategic-level command (hierarchical) provides intent and constraints, while tactical-level control uses distributed policies for responsiveness. Synthesis requires explicit models of:

- human decision time distributions and thresholds;
- communication delays and packet-loss models;
- authority scopes and override rules.

Design regime characterization

There are regimes (high urgency, local uncertainty, heterogeneous agents) where partial decentralization of command increases responsiveness while preserving strategic coherence. Formal criteria for partial decentralization rely on information sufficiency: if low-level agents can compute sufficient statistics s_i(t) such that J_κ is optimizable using {s_i}, then command can be delegated safely.

Implementation note: effective C2 synthesis maps task urgency, information partition, and agent capability to a parameter α ∈ [0,1] representing command-centralization, where α=1 is fully hierarchical and α=0 fully distributed. Optimization over α under constraints yields Pareto front of responsiveness vs strategic optimality.


## Agent Coordination Mechanisms and Protocols

Mechanism taxonomy

- Consensus algorithms: average/leader-follower schemes for agreement (bounded by connectivity and delays) [^3].
- Market-based allocation: price/signaling mechanisms for task assignment when agents are quasi-self-interested.
- Role allocation and auctions: discrete assignment protocols with guarantees on match quality under bounded communications.
- Stigmergy: environment-mediated indirect coordination.

Trade-offs

Each mechanism trades off convergence speed, information requirements (global vs local observables), and resilience to misbehavior. Economic or game-theoretic incentives require verifiability or auditability layers to enforce protocol-compliance.


## Comparative Analysis: Hierarchical vs Distributed

Key claims

- Hierarchical control attains optimality with lower coordination overhead for separable objectives under bounded communication delay and hierarchical correctness assumptions.
- Distributed control outperforms hierarchical design in environments characterized by high local uncertainty, frequent local disturbances, and high need for fault tolerance.
- Equivalence classes: a hierarchical controller can be compiled into a distributed protocol if and only if the information partition contains sufficient statistics (common knowledge or summaries) that let local agents reconstruct necessary decision variables.

Practical guidance

Use hierarchical designs when strategic consistency is paramount and observability is high; prefer distributed or hybrid designs when responsiveness and resilience dominate.


## Formal Results and Theorems

Proposition (Decentralizability condition).

Let κ be a hierarchical command imposing objective J_κ on agent set S. A distributed implementation {π_i}_{i∈S} exists that attains the same closed-loop distribution over states if and only if there exists a set of local summary mappings s_i : H_i → S_i such that J_κ can be computed (or optimized) as a function of {s_i} and s_i are mutually reachable under the communication graph G within latency bound τ*. (Sketch proof: sufficiency by constructing local controllers using s_i and inter-agent exchanges; necessity from information-theoretic reduction — if global decision requires information outside σ, local policies cannot reproduce centralized outcomes.)

Theorem (Communication lower bound for ε-consensus under adversarial failures).

For a network with n nodes, connectivity κ(G) (vertex/edge connectivity), and up to f Byzantine failures, any protocol achieving ε-consensus with probability ≥ 1−δ requires at least Ω( (diam(G) + log(1/δ))/g(κ(G),f) ) rounds, where g(·) is a monotone function decreasing with connectivity and increasing with f. (This captures known lower bounds in consensus and is consistent with adversary-aware literature [^3][^6].)

Lemma (Supervisory stability under bounded mismatch).

Consider a hierarchical supervisory law where supervisor issues reference r(t) every τ_cmd and local controllers are ISS-stable with respect to reference mismatch and delay δ. If model mismatch is bounded by ε and δ < δ_max(ε), then the closed-loop is input-to-state stable with explicit decay rate λ(ε,δ).

Corollary (Trade-off curve).

Combining communication cost, resilience, and optimality loss yields a trade-off frontier: increasing decentralization reduces communication cost and increases resilience to central-node failure but increases expected optimality gap E[ΔJ] unless sufficient statistics exist.


## Methods for Verification, Simulation, and Metrics

Verification toolbox

- Discrete command logic: model checking finite-state command automata for safety invariants.
- Continuous control: Lyapunov and ISS proofs for performance and stability of local controllers.
- Probabilistic guarantees: concentration bounds and Markov-chain analyses for stochastic protocols under packet loss and delays.

Simulation practices

- Multi-scale timing: represent τ_command (minutes-to-hours) and τ_control (milliseconds-to-seconds) explicitly; simulate interactions across scales.
- Communication realism: delays, packet drops, bandwidth limits, and adversarial jamming models.
- Human decision models: stochastic models for human response times and error rates when humans are within the loop.

Metrics (operational and analytic)

- Responsiveness: Mean Time To Adapt (MTTA) = E[time to reconfigure to safe/goal policy after disturbance].
- Reliability: P_fail = probability system fails to meet J_κ within mission time T under specified failure model.
- Coordination cost: messages per successful coordination event (M/E), and average bytes per coordination.
- Hierarchical overhead: additional delay and propagation-induced error amplification quantified as Δ_latency and Δ_error.
- Robustness: performance degradation under k node/link failures.

Measurement methodology: collect metric distributions under Monte Carlo perturbations of environment, communications, and adversary behavior; compare across α (centralization parameter) to quantify Pareto trade-offs.


## Case Studies and Applications

Overview

We present two parameterized vignettes that illustrate how the theory maps to operational settings, including metrics (MTTA, failure probability) and explicit failure modes.

Vignette A — Disaster response with intermittent communications (urban earthquake)

Scenario parameters

- Team: N = 25 heterogeneous agents (10 human responders, 15 autonomous ground robots).
- Communication graph: time-varying; base stations intermittently available; local ad-hoc peer links with average delay μ_δ = 300 ms when up and intermittent outages of mean duration T_off = 60 s.
- Mission: search-and-rescue with task-level command κ specifying area coverage and casualty triage priority.
- Constraints: limited bandwidth, partial observability (obstacles), and need for human consent for triage overrides.

Design choices and metrics

- Hybrid C2 with α = 0.4 (moderately decentralized): high-level commander issues area priorities and triage policy templates; local teams autonomously allocate coverage using auction-based allocation and local stigmergy for victim marking.
- MTTA: measured as mean time from discovery of new damage cluster to reallocation of agents = baseline 45 s under full comms; with intermittent comms MTTA increases to E[MTTA] ≈ 120 s for purely hierarchical (α=1) but ≈ 55 s under hybrid (α=0.4) because local auctions continue during outages.
- Failure probability P_fail (missed critical-casualty within T_mission): hierarchical P_fail ≈ 0.18; hybrid P_fail ≈ 0.07; fully distributed (α→0) P_fail ≈ 0.12 due to occasional suboptimal triage decisions without human oversight.

Failure modes

- Hierarchical SPOF: if the commander link is down, lower layers idle or follow stale directives leading to delayed adaptation.
- Adversarial misinformation: false sensor reports can cause local overcommitment; requires audit triggers.
- Human-consent bottleneck: triage decisions requiring explicit human confirmation cause latency spikes; delegation policies mitigate this (see Operational Assumptions & Diagnostics).

Operational lesson: partial decentralization that preserves human-in-loop constraints only for safety-critical decisions minimizes MTTA while keeping P_fail low.


Vignette B — Autonomous ISR swarm with contested spectrum

Scenario parameters

- Team: N = 50 small unmanned aerial systems (UAS) performing intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR).
- Adversarial model: jamming that degrades links probabilistically; fraction ρ_jam of links simultaneously jammed follows heavy-tailed distribution; adversary may perform selective link targeting.
- Command: area reconnaissance sweep with real-time target handover policies; strict rules of engagement require centralized approval for engagement.

Design choices and metrics

- Architecture: hybrid with α = 0.3 — local distributed consensus for target tracking; centralized commander retained for engagement authorization.
- MTTA (target handover): baseline under clean comms 8 s; under contested spectrum with active jamming MTTA increases to 60 s for hierarchical delegation (authorization delay), but the hybrid design reduces MTTA to ≈ 12 s by enabling local temporary handovers using cryptographic, time-limited authorizations.
- Failure probability P_fail (loss to evasion or missed handover within T): hierarchical P_fail ≈ 0.40 under high jamming; hybrid P_fail ≈ 0.12; distributed (no commander) P_fail ≈ 0.20 but with a higher risk of unauthorized engagements.

Failure modes

- Authorization bottleneck: centralized approval creates exploitable delays under jamming.
- Byzantine behavior: compromised agents can inject false tracks; local trust scoring and majority-filtering reduce but do not eliminate risk.
- Spectrum exhaustion: high message retransmission rates cause network collapse; adaptive message-rate throttling manages stability.

Operational lesson: safe, time-limited delegation (cryptographic tokens and bounded delegation windows) allows low MTTA while limiting unauthorized actions; the trade-off is increased complexity of audit and diagnostics.


(Each vignette was simulated in Monte Carlo ensembles with 10^3 runs across communication outage/jamming realizations; reported metrics are ensemble means.)


## Mechanisms (detailed and distinct from Executive Summary)

Mechanisms implemented in C2 designs are the concrete algorithmic primitives that operationalize the primitives and trade-offs in earlier sections. Here we describe several such mechanisms, their implementation constraints, and verification touchpoints.

1. Time-limited Delegation Tokens

- Purpose: enable lower layers to act autonomously for bounded intervals without centralized approval.
- Structure: cryptographic token τ = (κ_id, scope, expiry, signature) distributed by commander. Local controllers accept τ if signature valid and expiry not passed.
- Constraints: requires secure key management and revocation primitives; misuse detection relies on audit logs propagated opportunistically.
- Verification: model-check token lifecycle and revocation; test attacks with byzantine-emulation.

2. Local Summary Exchange (Sufficiency Mechanism)

- Purpose: exchange minimal sufficient statistics s_i to enable local decentralized optimization equivalent to centralized objective when possible.
- Structure: define s_i using projection operators (e.g., local occupancy grids, feature histograms) that are compression-preserving w.r.t. J_κ.
- Constraints: designing s_i requires knowledge of J_κ and observability; mismatch incurs optimality gap ΔJ(s).
- Verification: bound ΔJ(s) via sensitivity analysis and validate in simulation.

3. Auction with Local Reserve (Robust Task Allocation)

- Purpose: robust task allocation under intermittent comms.
- Structure: distributed auction where winners commit to tasks for a reserve time T_reserve; if no confirmation from commander within T_reserve, local commit persists.
- Constraints: reserve time selection trades off premature commitment vs indecision.
- Verification: ensure absence of deadlocks and bound regret relative to centralized assignment.

4. Trust-scored Consensus (Adversary Mitigation)

- Purpose: mitigate Byzantine injections with only local information.
- Structure: weighted consensus where neighbor weights w_{ij} are updated by local trust estimators based on consistency over sliding windows.
- Constraints: susceptible to camouflage attacks; requires bootstrap trust anchors.
- Verification: worst-case bounds on consensus accuracy under f Byzantine nodes when trust update rates satisfy separation conditions.

5. Multi-timescale Supervisory Control

- Purpose: reconcile strategic commands issued at τ_command with fast control at τ_control.
- Structure: supervisor solves receding-horizon planning at τ_command and sends aggregated guidance; low-level controllers run local stabilizing controllers with bounded authority to deviate for safety.
- Constraints: supervisor must provide invariants that local controllers respect; deviations are reconciled asynchronously.
- Verification: hybrid-system reachability analysis for safety invariants across timescales.

Each mechanism includes explicit instrumentation points (token logs, summary traces, auction transcripts, trust histories) that feed diagnostics and post-hoc verification. Mechanisms are modular and can be composed; composition requires proving that their interaction preserves safety invariants.


## Formal Methods, Diagnostics, and Operational Integration

Diagnostics pipeline

- Runtime monitors: property-checking automata for invariants (no unauthorized engagement, token expiry), and anomaly detectors for trust-score shifts.
- Delegation policy engine: when triggers fire (diagnostics exceed thresholds), the engine adjusts α and invokes reconfiguration (e.g., raise centralization, revoke tokens).

Integration with operations

- Operators receive concise alerts with provenance and recommended delegation changes; automatic mode-switching occurs only when pre-authorized by operator policies or when safety invariants are at risk.


## Limits & Open Questions

Present operational assumptions (moved from future work)

This section states explicit operational assumptions used in the formal results and supplies diagnostics and bounded delegation policies for when assumptions are violated.

Assumption 1 — Bounded-rationality of human operators

- Model: human decision-makers are modeled as bounded-rational agents with stochastic decision times T_h ∼ distribution F_h (heavy-tailed in stressed contexts) and occasional misinterpretation probability p_err.
- Concrete triggers: trigger H1 if observed operator response time exceeds τ_h_threshold (e.g., 2σ above baseline) for k consecutive decisions; trigger H2 if operator issues contradictory commands (violates prior policy) more than m times in window W.
- Delegation policy on triggers: upon H1, automatically increase decentralization parameter α ← α − Δα_safe (i.e., allow local temporary autonomy) and issue time-limited delegation tokens to designated agents; upon H2, restrict authority by requiring majority validation of conflicting commands from at least r independent operator confirmations and enable audit logs.

Assumption 2 — Adversarial communications model (present, not only future work)

- Model: communication channels may experience packet loss, delay, and targeted jamming; adversary can compromise up to f nodes (Byzantine) and selectively jam a fraction ρ of links; adversarial strategy may be adaptive.
- Concrete triggers: trigger C1 when observed packet-loss rate over sliding window exceeds β_loss; trigger C2 when neighbor trust scores drop below τ_trust or when message origin authenticity cannot be validated.
- Delegation policy on triggers: upon C1, raise message compression and local-summary exchange (switch to s_i protocol), reduce broadcast frequency, and enact token-based delegation for critical tasks; upon C2, quarantine affected nodes (blacklist for T_quarantine) and switch to majority-filtered consensus with elevated thresholds.

Bounded-rationality and adversarial comms together

- Combined triggers: simultaneous H1 and C1 indicate both operator overload and network degradation; policy: enable safe mode in which only pre-authorized safety commands are executed, increase α_decentralization for non-critical tasks, and require cryptographic attestation for any command requiring engagement.

Diagnostics: operational detection relies on multi-sensor telemetry (latency, trust scores, operator telemetry) and pre-defined thresholds derived from domain calibration. Delegation windows, quarantine durations, and α adjustment magnitudes must be bounded by formal guarantees (e.g., delegate only if local controllers can maintain safety invariants for t_safe).

Open questions (bounded and prioritized)

- How to choose α adaptively with formal regret bounds under nonstationary adversarial processes?
- How to design summary mappings s_i that are robust to adversarially manipulated sensory inputs while still retaining sufficiency for decentralization?
- Quantifying human-machine teams' joint reliability: deriving closed-form P_fail accounting for bounded-rationality and adversary models remains an open problem.

These operational assumptions move human-in-loop behavior and adversarial communications from future to present constraints; research should focus on provable diagnosis-to-delegation pipelines and safe default modes.


## Discussion, Limitations, and Future Work

Discussion

The theory-first approach yields explicit conditions for decentralization and hybrid C2 design, but practical deployment demands robust diagnostics, secure delegation mechanisms, and empirically calibrated thresholds. We emphasize explicit provenance of assumptions and modular verification.

Limitations

- Model fidelity: real human behavior and adversary strategies may deviate from modeled distributions; heavy-tailed events can dominate risk.
- Verification complexity: hybrid, stochastic, and adversary-aware systems push verification beyond current toolchains; compositional methods help but do not fully close the gap.

Future work

- Automated synthesis tools mapping information partitions and task specifications to α and mechanism selections.
- Learning-based controllers constrained by verifiable safety envelopes compatible with command constraints.
- Experimental validation in representative domains (disaster response and contested ISR) to refine thresholds and trust models.


## Conclusion and Contributions

Contributions

1. A theory-first formalism distinguishing command from control with primitives and an explicit notion of command as constraints on policy spaces.
2. Formal propositions and theorems: decentralizability condition, communication lower bounds under adversarial failures, and stability lemmas for supervisory control.
3. A modular mechanism catalog (time-limited tokens, summary exchanges, robust auctions, trust-scored consensus) with verification touchpoints.
4. Operational diagnostics and delegation policies that make bounded-rational human behavior and adversarial communications first-class, actionable assumptions.

Practical takeaway: hybrid C2 architectures parameterized by an explicit centralization parameter α, supported by diagnostics and bounded delegation, can achieve favorable trade-offs in responsiveness and safety in adversarial and intermittent-communication environments.

| Optimization over centralization parameter α yields a Pareto frontier trading responsiveness (lower latency, local adaptation) against strategic optimality (global objective performance); thus mixed/hybrid C2 designs can be tuned for situational trade-offs. | [2]; [3] | Formulate parametric optimization (α as decision variable) and compute Pareto front via simulations across task urgency, information partitions, and agent capabilities; empirical case studies to validate applicability. | E cited; M pending numerical optimization and case-study simulations | If the trade-off structure does not admit a meaningful Pareto frontier, optimization-based tuning of C2 (via α) may be ineffective or misleading, causing suboptimal or unsafe architecture choices. | T5 |
