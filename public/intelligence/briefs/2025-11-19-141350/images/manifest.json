Key objects: Printed play cards labeled S1–S5 (behavioral, cultural, market, tech, discount), Fabric swatches and sample packaging, A/B test matrices on matte paper, Brass pins and acetate overlays (studio material cues). Lighting: Polished editorial lighting with confident highlights on faces and hands, soft falloff into clean negative space. Mood: Precise, collaborative, decisive — calm urgency.
