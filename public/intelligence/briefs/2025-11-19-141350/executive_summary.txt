Run adjacent early-holiday and parade-week tests in a priority market to see whether shifting effort earlier captures demand without eroding margin [^4][^1]. Design the parade-week activation to detect an 8–12% foot-traffic uplift versus baseline stores as a test target, informed by parade-week concentration of attention [^1][^5]. Size the 2–4 week early-holiday program to detect a 10–15% rise in early-deal share versus last year, and have merchandising, analytics, store ops and marketing finalize offers, control stores, sample sizing and tracking definitions within 30 days [^4][^3].
