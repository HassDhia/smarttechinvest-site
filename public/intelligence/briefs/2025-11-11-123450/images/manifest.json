The minimalist object—glowing traces suggesting information throughput—reads as an emblem of AI industrialization, technological–bureaucratic feedback loops and scaled influence in the emerging “cognitive wars,” set against generous negative space for a magazine masthead.. clean editorial photography, soft daylight, cool slate/steel palette, no text or lettering, single subject, generous negative space, magazine cover aesthetic, depth-of-field, subtle contrast, not a poster, not a collage, not an infographic, no charts, no UI, no labels",
