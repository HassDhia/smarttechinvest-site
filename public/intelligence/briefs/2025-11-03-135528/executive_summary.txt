The rapid expansion of AI and data‑center builds is already reshaping power markets: surging demand is driving short‑term increases in U.S. nuclear generation and creating enduring pockets of scarcity that favor firm, low‑carbon suppliers and deep‑pocket buyers. Hyperscalers are gaining pricing and shaping power via long‑dated PPAs, in‑house energy teams, and balance‑sheet investments, while nuclear and other firm resources capture countervailing leverage as buyers require predictable 24/7 supply. Capital is reallocating to compute, enabling generation, transmission upgrades and long‑duration storage, with private equity and infrastructure funds financing long‑dated projects. For operators, energy must become a first‑class constraint: integrate substation and PPA planning into 24–60 month capacity forecasts, deploy energy‑aware schedulers, telemetry stacks and on‑site storage, and harden firmware/security. Investors should prioritize contracted clean‑firm assets, grid integrators, data‑center REITs with embedded energy solutions and AI hardware suppliers, while pricing in permitting, interconnection and construction risks. Business development should commercialize bundled site+firm‑power offerings, JV captive plants, and energy‑as‑a‑service with clear risk sharing. Immediate actions: accelerate contracted offtakes for firm clean power, invest in transmission and long‑duration capacity, standardize energy APIs and telemetry, and pilot bundled energy+compute deals with anchor customers. Measure outcomes and iterate contracts to manage risk and capture value durably.
