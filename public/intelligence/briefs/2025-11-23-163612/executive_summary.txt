This quick test targets a unified holiday pack with **10–15%** detectable foot-traffic uplift (stretch **≥25%** in top markets), an **early-window transaction share goal 20–30%** (vs **~12–15%** baseline), an **event CPA target ≤0.80×** baseline, and **QR/scan redemption ≥5%** of footfall to close the visit-to-buy loop [^1][^3][^4]. We will run an A/B framing inside the same two-week window: Arm A = legacy markdowns vs Arm B = bundle + gift‑with‑purchase + loyalty incentive, measuring attendance, conversion, and CPA head‑to‑head [^2][^4]. **Within 30 days, teams must** lock site windows and staffing, instrument door counts and QR→POS attribution, finalize creative and inventory splits for Arm A vs Arm B, and agree an A/B holdout and weekly reporting cadence to validate the pack against the quantitative anchors above [^1][^2][^3].
