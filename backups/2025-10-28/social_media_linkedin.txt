Data point: Financial Times coverage (live Q&A 27 Oct; follow-ups 28–30 Oct) and FT reporting that EY has rolled agent access to “everyone” signal a hard shift — AI agents are leaving the lab. Two adoption cohorts are emerging: agent-as‑co‑worker enterprises vs. ChatGPT/Claude casual users. Confidence: 0.80.

This split matters because the second wave is operational, not experimental. Signals: FT’s coverage + EY’s org‑wide rollout show production use; dozens of labour studies show no broad job collapse yet, but concentrated disruption among freelancers and junior programmers. The mechanism is clear — firms that treat agents as stateful, connectorized, observable systems unlock productivity; those that treat them as chat tools get marginal gains.

Operational implications for leaders:
- Build stateful agent architectures, secure connector fabrics and centralized connector governance.
- Invest in observability, autoscaling and hybrid inference to control cost and reliability.
- Standardize prompt/embedding practices, institute CI/CD for agents and embed security (SOC/ISO/HIPAA) in procurement.
- Prioritize measurable pilots (time‑saved KPIs), bundled platform+services pricing with compliance tiers, hyperscaler + SI partnerships and reskilling programs.

Investor & BD signals: allocate to platform/cloud incumbents, agent‑orchestration and compliance specialists, and compute/hardware suppliers; value enterprise moats and measurable ROI over pure research plays.

Forecast / call to action: launch a 90‑day measurable pilot, secure connectors and compliance, and fund a workforce transition plan — those who combine agent tech with organizational change will capture value; laggards risk rapid commoditisation.
