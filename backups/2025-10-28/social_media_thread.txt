1/5 Agents are no longer experiments — they're being rolled into every desk. FT live Q&A (Sarah O’Connor & John Burn‑Murdoch, 2025‑10‑27) + FT reporting that EY made agents “available to everyone” (2025‑10‑29) signal enterprise adoption is here. Confidence 0.80.
2/5 Key split: firms are diverging into two cohorts — treating AI agents as co‑workers vs. letting staff use ChatGPT/Claude as chat tools. Dozens of labour analyses show no mass job loss yet, but disruption is concentrated among freelancers & junior programmers.
3/5 Operator playbook: build stateful agent architectures, secure connector fabrics, observability + autoscaling, hybrid inference. Standardize prompts & embeddings, centralize connectors, institute CI/CD, governance & reskilling. Pilot = survival, scale = moat.
4/5 Investor & BD lens: overweight platform/cloud incumbents, agent‑orchestration, compliance specialists, compute/hardware. Value SOC/ISO/HIPAA, connectors, measurable ROI over pure‑research bets. Win with time‑saved KPI pilots, bundled platform+services, hyperscaler & SI partnerships.
5/5 Forecast / call to action — Operator POV: launch measurable, stateful pilot in 90 days; prioritize certified security & workforce transition programs. Investor POV: overweight orchestration/compliance, underweight commodity research. Winners marry tech with org change; laggards get commoditised.
